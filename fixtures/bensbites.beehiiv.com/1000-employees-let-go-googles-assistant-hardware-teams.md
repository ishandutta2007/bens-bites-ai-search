## What does this mean?

Google is restructuring and downsizing teams to align resources with top priorities. Layoffs cover its Google Assistant team and hardware (especially AR). Layoffs in its ad services units are expected to happen soon.

Google is facing growing competition in AI and hardware from companies like Amazon and startups. Rabbit R1 sales were more than $4M (though chump change for Google) in 48 hours. Amazon is adding LLMs and other [AI-powered skills to Alexa](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/alexa-gets-ai-skills-characters-music-20questions) by partnering with AI startups.

## Why should I care?

The Information’s founder Jessica Lessin thinks [we shouldn’t count Google out.](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/dont-count-google-out?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=1000-employees-let-go-from-google-s-assistant-and-hardware-teams)Layoffs hint that it’s getting rid of the bloat and has serious plans to get AI into products. With talent like Fitbit’s founders leaving along with this “restructure” there is the other end of predictions: Google is (yet again) falling behind.
