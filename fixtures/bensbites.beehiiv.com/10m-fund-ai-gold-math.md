# $10M fund for AI to a gold in math

[The AI-MO Prize is a new $10 million challenge fund](https://aimoprize.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=10m-fund-for-ai-to-a-gold-in-math) launched by XTX Markets to accelerate the development of AI models that can reason mathematically and solve problems at a level comparable to high-performing humans.

## What’s going on here?

The $10M AIMO fund puts up a challenge to get AI to do math (and get a gold medal).

## What does this mean?

AIMO fund will award progress prizes for models that achieve milestones, plus a $5 million grand prize for the first publicly shared model that wins a gold medal equivalent in an approved AI math competition.

The first approved competitions, with progress presentations at the 2024 International Math Olympiad (IMO), will help compare different AI problem-solving strategies in a way accessible to the general public.

As per Fields medalist and IMO winner Terence Tao, people would be eager to know if AI can match the world’s brightest young mathematical minds. You bet we would.

## Why should I care?

Reasoning and planning are two major drawbacks of models like GPTs (autoregressive LLMs). IMO problems require both at a great level to solve them (there’s an average of 3 hours of time to solve a single question).

The AI-MO Prize connects AI progress to this benchmark of mathematical excellence. IMO gold medalists become leaders in science, engineering and technology, so an AI matching that achievement could profoundly impact these fields.
