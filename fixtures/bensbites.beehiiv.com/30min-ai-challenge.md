[ChatGPT created a full-on marketing campaign in just 30 minutes](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/superhuman-what-can-ai-do-in-30-minutes)

OK, it‚Äôs official -**superhuman powers**are a real thing and all it took to get there was ChatGPT. Ethan Mollick gave himself a test:*see how much he could get done in 30 minutes using the AI*. And as far as I can tell, he‚Äôs basically achieved what would previously have taken at least a day. For a**mock marketing campaign**, he did extensive market research, created a positioning document, wrote an email campaign, created a website, and a logo, and even scripted and created a deep fake video for the biz. If someone told you they could do all that a couple of years ago*you would literally think they‚Äôre a superhero*. All this begs one last question:**how do we utilise**our newfound powers? Do we work more or less? Who benefits from this? Companies or employees? What happens to leisure time? I could go on all day‚Ä¶

**2/**

[Databricks say their Dolly model is as good as ChatGPT and easier to use](https://twitter.com/bleedingedgeai/status/1639366897279057924)

Time to add one more competitor to the queue of smaller language models trying to give OpenAI a run for their money, and it‚Äôs even been named after a sheep‚Ä¶ With the goal of democratising AI away from Big Tech,**Databricks**has released a fully open-sourced model called**Dolly**, and they reckon it manages to exhibit the ‚Äúmagical‚Äù human interaction capabilities that ChatGPT has. Built off EleutherAI‚Äôs GPT-J-6B, it‚Äôs been fine-tuned on a dataset of 50,000 words in just 3 hours -*rapido*!

**3/**

[The secret history of Elon Musk and OpenAI‚Äôs Sam Altman](https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai)

With**OpenAI‚Äôs**products rapidly taking over our lives, let‚Äôs take the chance to step back and listen to**where it all began**, as well as some behind-the-scenes**drama**between two of tech‚Äôs biggest names - Sam Altman and Elon Musk. Whatever you might think of him since his Twitter tirade, the fact is that he was there at OpenAI from the start, driving the original non-profit approach of democratising AI. This Semafor article runs us through**Elon‚Äôs exit**from the firm and his refusal to pay the $1bln he promised (fair enough, I guess); the pivot to a transformer-focussed model that‚Äôs driving what we‚Äôre seeing today; the shift from a non-profit to a for-profit with a $30bln valuation; and whether we‚Äôre seeing a*liiiiittle bit*of sourness from Musk since he‚Äôs no longer a part of the hottest thing in tech.

**4/**

[OpenAI Plugin Protocol gets integrated into the LangChain library](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1639351690251100160)

Let‚Äôs squeeze in a cheeky little fourth pick for those of you who like to get down and dirty with code.**LangChain**, as ever, has followed the latest AI development at lightning speed. Since OpenAI released their**Plugin Protocol**- the ability to execute actions on apps from within ChatGPT - LangChain has updated their toolkit with an ‚ÄòAIPluginTool‚Äô - great work driving open AI development forward! Check out the tweet linked above to see a simple set-up for it.
