## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

I spoke with Jasper founder, Dave Rogenmoser and asked him a couple of questions given their insane growth in 18 months to a $1.5bn valuation. The standard questions of backstory, pivots etc can be found in [his thread](https://twitter.com/DaveRogenmoser/status/1582362508362280960). But here‚Äôs what I asked him:

\*\*What is one belief about ai that may be contrary to most people?\*\*I don't know how contrary this is to people in the know, but the models are a commodity in the future. No moat there. One great moat is in the data you use to train and fine-tune the models. I also think too many people are geeking out on AI tech and the real money to be made is in taking that and making it truly useful to the world.

\*\*What are you excited about in AI?\*\*This is the greatest space ever. I love how helpful everyone is to each other with a willingness to partner up. I think what we've done better than most is go really deep in understanding the customer and building for them. It's all we care about. It's all we talk about. We've flown under the radar in the tech world, because we just want to be famous to our customers. I'm a marketer at heart, and we've been building for marketers for 8 years, so to us this isn't just some cool technology, but a breakthrough for a very big pain point for marketers everywhere. Obsessing over the customer, rather than the tech, competitors, or ourselves, is a true superpower.

Jasper [wrote a note to customers](https://www.jasper.ai/blog/2022-customer-letter) about their mammoth funding round.

- **[$250k to work on generative AI](https://foundationcapital.com/ai250kchallenge/)**. That‚Äôs the challenge Foundation Capital has set. The best will receive a $250K SAFE (uncapped, no discount) investment. [Reach out directly](mailto:jgupta@foundationcap.com) to Jaya with any questions.

- **AI is not here to get rid of writers, it‚Äôs [here to augment human creativity](https://every.to/cybernaut/an-ai-might-have-written-this)**. An article from Every writer (the company behind Lex), [FADEKE ADEGBUYI,](https://every.to/@fadeke_adegbuyi) wrote this piece (and Nathan didn‚Äôt know it was being written, very timely). The article explores how writers are writing *with* AI, one example said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt use it to generate words, more for giving me ideas and provocations for directions that I should go,‚Äù.

- [**Create your own 3D avatar**](https://twitter.com/liuziwei7/status/1582370918147293186), in plain English. Now you CAN put your height as 6ft on Tinder. (but asterisk it as your 3D avatar, that‚Äôs sure to help with dates)

- We all know the ways we can manipulate images, colour, contrast, saturation, blur, sharpen etc. But **why aren‚Äôt we thinking of manipulating text** in the same way? [This blog post](https://stephanango.com/photoshop-for-text) explores that idea.

- No more folding clothes, Hurray! **[Robotic arms can now fold clothes](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1582555774177665025)** for you. Erm, 1, please.

- [A short thread](https://twitter.com/annarchyy/status/1582530538711052288) on **why Generative AI may be similar to the web3 hype**. It touches on raising money on insane valuations (which we‚Äôve seen), whether will they become long-budget arms for business etc. My view is that AI is just another tool. Computers enable you to do a job productively. Google is a tool to look up anything I don‚Äôt know. AI is a tool that enables more productive work. Sure there‚Äôs going to be a bunch of gimmicks along the way. Everything starts off as a toy‚Ä¶
