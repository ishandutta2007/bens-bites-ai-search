## What does that mean?

So, in simple words, a16z’s shabang is: AI will explode personal creativity, productivity and relationships. This will give rise to consumer companies which will grow insanely fast and have high user retention. a16z is all up for funding such ideas.

They highlight some major focus areas for each of these enhancements:

- **Creativity + Productivity:** Content generation, AI native content editing and tools that do stuff.

- \*\*Companionship + Social:\*\*AI as a companion/friend and AI as tool to connect with friends, partners etc.

- **Personal Growth:** AI for education, personal finance or wellness.

The document has more details on each of these and additional resources to go deeper.
