## Why should I care?

These Firefly developments are significant for creators. The new models and features allow generation of high-quality, customizable images, vectors, and templates more easily. The additional creator control over things like image quality and style matching enables realizing your vision better.

These can save time starting projects or creating assets. And that’s what Adobe is aiming for—to get the adoption by creators who are bread and butter of its media tools.

Again, the legal and copyright assurance that Adobe provides is a sigh of relief for creators/designers who want to use AI in their day jobs. Adobe’s promise of compensating stock contributors also gets them the ethics points.
