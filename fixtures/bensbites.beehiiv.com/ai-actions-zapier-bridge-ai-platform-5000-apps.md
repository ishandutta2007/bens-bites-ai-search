# AI Actions by Zapier - The bridge between your AI platform and 5000+ apps.

[Zapier introduces new AI Actions feature](https://actions.zapier.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-actions-by-zapier-the-bridge-between-your-ai-platform-and-5000-apps), which allows AI platforms to use Zapier's existing integrations and actions. AI Actions enables AI systems to execute workflows and automations through Zapier's platform without needing to build custom integrations.

## What's going on here?

Zapier launches AI Actions - A tool for builders to run any Zapier action from AI platforms.

## What does this mean?

AI Actions gives AI platforms access to Zapier's catalog of 20,000+ actions like sending Slack messages, creating HubSpot leads, or drafting Gmail replies. This removes the typical hurdles of third-party authentication and API integration. Now, an AI system's natural language command can act as the trigger, and Zapier's actions handle the execution.

AI Actions supports major AI platforms like ChatGPT and GPT models out of the box. It can also be used natively within Zapier to enable automations there. Finally, developers can build custom private integrations using the AI Actions REST API and API keys.

## Why should I care?

With AI Actions, you can quickly automate workflows leveraging existing Zapier actions. No longer needing to build custom APIs saves significant development time and resources.

And since you can use natural language, the automations can be done by the non-technical team members as well, freeing up the engineers for technically hard problems.
