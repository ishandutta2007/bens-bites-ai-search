# The AI app store is out

OpenAI has launched the [GPT Store](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-the-gpt-store?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=the-ai-app-store-is-out) and [ChatGPT Team](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-chatgpt-team?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=the-ai-app-store-is-out) plan to expand access to large language models for creators and businesses.

## What's going on here?

OpenAI has launched the GPT store and a new Teams plan for ChatGPT subscriptions.

## What does this mean?

Reminder: 2 months back OpenAI launched custom chatbots inside ChatGPT, calling them GPTs. These GPTs can be shared publicly or have restricted access.

With the new GPT store, you can find all public GPTs in a single place. OpenAI will highlight trending GPTs and top GPTs for several categories every week. The big deal about the GPT Store is the promised revenue share program but we gotta wait for more info on that (not too much, OpenAI says rollout in Q1 2024).

ChatGPT Team is the new plan on ChatGPT for shared workspaces where you can share chats, private GPTs and a dashboard to manage it all. It is pricier: $25/user/month if billed annually ($30 if monthly). You get more messages with GPT-4, longer context lengths and training on your data is default OFF. (a note: you can disable it on simple ChatGPT Plus too, itâ€™s just on by default there)

## Why should I care?

Repeating Samâ€™s statement from Dev Day: GPTs are the first step to agents or assistants that will do everything for you. And in that case, chat does feel like the universal interface for interacting with agents. I find optimism in believing that this is an app store moment (and not the end of work ðŸ˜…) and even if it is we have a transition stage to cross. Also, more improvements in GPTs about learning continuously, and getting more personalized are [also underway.](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1745124363362578527?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=the-ai-app-store-is-out) So, get building.
