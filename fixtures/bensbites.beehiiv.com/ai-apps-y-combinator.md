Hello folks, here’s what we have today;

##### <mark>**Our picks**</mark>

[**Inworld becomes the best-funded startup in AI and games.**](https://inworld.ai/blog/inworld-valued-at-500-million?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-apps-from-y-combinator)That’s what the Nasdaq billboard says on Inworld’s latest funding round**raising $50M**from Lightspeed and others, valued at $500M. Inworld makes**AI-driven NPCs (non-playing characters) for games and other applications.**

I think we’ll see the use of AI NPCs in big games as soon as 2024. Youtubers have already been modding GTA V and other games with AI.

[**Meta releases another open-source model - Audiocraft**](https://ai.meta.com/blog/audiocraft-musicgen-audiogen-encodec-generative-ai-audio/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-apps-from-y-combinator)**.**Audiocraft is their new AI model that generates**high-quality, realistic audio and music**from text-based user inputs. It’s**trained on raw audio signals**instead of MIDI or piano rolls, so I guess that makes the difference.

I am wondering if this is the model they said are too scared to release a couple months back. Nonetheless, Meta feels like it’s on one of those Github streaks of contributing to**open-source projects.**

**[AI governance at scale - Trustible Becomes Official Databricks Technology Partner](https://www.trustible.ai/post/ai-governance-at-scale-trustible-becomes-official-databricks-technology-partner?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-apps-from-y-combinator)\*\*\*\*.**Trustible will provide its**governance and responsible deployment**systems to Databricks customers. So they can comply with external audits, post-market monitoring, and public disclosure requirements.

It’s interesting to see different playbooks from incumbents trying to reserve a spot in the Gen AI space. Meta’s is releasing models in the open, where**Databricks**is acquiring and partnering with small, world-class teamsto bring all the AI features to their data lakehouse. Earlier, it was Mosaic ML, and this time it’s Trustible.
