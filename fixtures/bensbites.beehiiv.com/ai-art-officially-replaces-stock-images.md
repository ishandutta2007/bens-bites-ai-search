### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[The **inside story of ChatGPT**: How OpenAI founder Sam Altman built the world‚Äôs hottest technology with billions from Microsoft.](https://archive.is/LqD2t) (long read, but worth it)

This article discusses the impact of OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot, which has been used to debug code, write recipes, scripts, and more, and how it has sparked a revolution.

**2/**

**[Five pieces of advice](https://twitter.com/nbashaw/status/1618298006138421249)**[for those building in AI right now](https://twitter.com/nbashaw/status/1618298006138421249).

I really like Nathan and the way he articulates what he's thinking when building products. I also happen to really like the products he builds. Some advice he shares in his thread: Resist broad generalisations, AI isn't anyones moat, products using AI aren't just 'wrappers', ignore the hype, and AI-powered applications are mostly not about AI. ([link](https://twitter.com/nbashaw/status/1618298006138421249))

**3/**

[After inking its OpenAI deal, Shutterstock rolls out a generative AI toolkit to create images based on text prompts](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/after-inking-its-openai-deal-shutterstock-rolls-out-a-generative-ai-toolkit-to-create-images-based-on-text-prompts/).

If stock photography firm Shutterstock were a person in the 1960s, they‚Äôd be a long-bearded hippie singing ‚ÄúMake love, not war man‚Äù from the rooftops.

Indeed, they‚Äôre proving to be a shining example of a large company **embracing AI** with strength. Whilst **Getty Images** have been getting into fisty-cuffs and legal battles over **rights to use their images** for AI art model training, Shutterstock have been handing their images to OpenAI and others for training, *and*[**training their own models**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/after-inking-its-openai-deal-shutterstock-rolls-out-a-generative-ai-toolkit-to-create-images-based-on-text-prompts/), *and*giving licensing rights to the artistic creators. They‚Äôre now in a strong position to benefit from the tech and be on the right side of its users.

**4/**

[Modeling a robot with some added difficulty.](https://echoesofsomewhere.com/2023/01/25/modeling-a-robot-with-some-added-difficulty/)

Are robots gonna take over the world? Maybe. Probably not. Should we spend 4-5 hours using AI to design awesome-looking ones with little antennas and an industrial aesthetic? Absolutely.

This [**post modelling robots**](https://echoesofsomewhere.com/2023/01/25/modeling-a-robot-with-some-added-difficulty/) is a great example of the **effort that is still required** to produce truly excellent results: artistry, patience, and skill. It works through the **creation of game robots** applying prompting, modelling, texture projection and more, taking \*4-5 hours.\*And this **effort is a** ***good*** ***sign***. It‚Äôs living proof that AI is not here to imminently steal creative and process-driven jobs, but to help **enhance our roles** in them, increase productivity, and improve output.

If stock photography firm Shutterstock were a person in the 1960s, they‚Äôd be a long-bearded hippie singing ‚ÄúMake love, not war man‚Äù from the rooftops.
