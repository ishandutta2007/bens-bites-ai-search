# AI is changing marketing jobs, or is it?

[AI is changing marketing jobs, or is it?](https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-anticipated-wave-of-ai-specialist-jobs-has-yet-to-arrive-01a8169c?mod=followamazon\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-is-changing-marketing-jobs-or-is-it)There's been lots of hype about how AI will revolutionize marketing, but so far big brands haven't created many new roles dedicated to overseeing this transformation.

## What's going on here?

Despite predictions that AI will fundamentally alter marketing, major consumer brands have largely not hired people for AI-specific leadership positions or changed their organizational structures.

## What does this mean?

Companies seem to be moving slowly and deliberately, rather than rushing to appoint "AI evangelists". They want to avoid past mistakes like overhyping technology like NFTs. Legal and cultural challenges around using AI in a responsible, on-brand way have also slowed adoption.

The outlier (or visionary) is Coco-Cola here. It has promoted two executives to the newly created roles of global head of generative AI and global head of marketing AI.

## Why should I care?

Data from Indeed says that marketing jobs with AI requirements were 8% lower in November than last year same time. And from Linkedin, the data shows that total views for marketing job listings that mentioned AI grew 14% faster than views for marketing jobs that didnâ€™t.

So, another way to look at it is that AI will become a default part of these jobs and skill sets without needing to be a special role.
