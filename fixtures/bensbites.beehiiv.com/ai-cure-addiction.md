### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Spirit Me lets you create AI-generated videos of yourself talking**](https://spiritme.tech/)

Have you ever wondered what you‚Äôd look like if you were the baby of dubbed films and sound delays? Nah, nor have I actually. Anyhow, **Spirit Me** is a cool new tool that creates your **digital avatar**, works some **voice cloning** magic, and makes it possible for you to create **fake videos of yourself**talking about whatever you want to a camera. Despite looking a little like my first description, this is probably the best attempt at something like this that I‚Äôve seen yet! Kinda creepy, but cool nonetheless.

**2/**

[**Gary Marcus brings us back to reality after we all laughed at Bing AI**](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/why-is-bing-so-reckless)

I feel like I‚Äôm back at school about to burst with laughter whilst getting told off, as Gary Marcus is giving the AI community a slap on the back of the wrist for not taking the **crazy Bing AI stories**more seriously! He argues that the **media have been irresponsible** when reporting Bing AI in a positive/funny way, and that they need to address the serious issues in its manic responses.

If updates to LLMs are able to go so awry, then we seriously need to address the ease with which companies can update their AIs. According to him, lawmakers need to be **faster to adapt regulation** and people need to**take the issue more seriously**. You‚Äôre grounded for laughing at Bing!

**3/**

[**Researchers use AI to discover medicine to reduce opioid dependence**](https://scitechdaily.com/how-ai-can-help-create-and-optimize-drugs-to-treat-opioid-addiction/?utm_content=cmp-true)

More positive AI **developments in biology** - just what the doctor ordered! Using AI, researchers claim to have discovered a number of compounds that are showing promise to decrease opioid dependence as a medicine. They used **reinforcement learning** techniques with rewards favourable to drug discovery, with the aim of identifying inhibitors of kappa-opioid receptors. Those are the ones that cause the need to use drugs during the withdrawal period. With the **US‚Äôs opioid dependence problem**, this is just the sort of thing we want to see, and could one day save millions of lives from addiction.
