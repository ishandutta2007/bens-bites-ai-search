[NYU has launched a journalism program to focus on ethics issues revolving around AI.](https://www.nyu.edu/about/news-publications/news/2023/august/arthur-l--carter-journalism-institute-launches-ethics-initiative.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-ethics-program-by-nyu-and-open-ai)This program is**backed by Open AI with a $395,000 grant**and will include workshops, research, and resources for students.**Stephen Adler**, who served as editor-in-chief of Reuters from 2011 to 2021 will head this initiative.Open AI is getting involved in journalism a lot these days with partnerships with leading news providers and now this initiative.

**2/**

[So, Nvidia is back at making waves with their SIGGRAPH 2023 keynote in LA.](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/08/08/siggraph-2023-special-address/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-ethics-program-by-nyu-and-open-ai)This keynote from Jensen Huang, Nvidia’s founder, has three major updates.

- The Grace Hopper Superchip, NVIDIA GH200, went into full production in May, and GH200 will have the ability to**connect multiple GPUs.**

- [Nvidia is partnering with HuggingFace](https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-and-hugging-face-to-connect-millions-of-developers-to-generative-ai-supercomputing?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-ethics-program-by-nyu-and-open-ai)for developers to create, test and fine-tune generative AI models on any cloud. So devs can now**train models on HF**and deploy it using Nvidia’s AI workbench.

- You can now**generate AI content in Nvidia’s Omniverse**with a focus on the USD format to create virtual worlds. It includes multiple AI-related integrations with Adobe, Wonder Dynamics and Luma AI, etc.

**3/**

[Project IDX from Google aims to simplify launching full-stack applications.](https://idx.dev/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-ethics-program-by-nyu-and-open-ai)Feels like Google’s going back to it developing AngularJS days. In Google’s words, IDX is a**web-based workspace for developing multi-platform apps.**Kinda like Google Docs but for coding. It’s still a waitlist, but it will support many popular languages and frameworks and**include Codey as AI coding copilot.**

**4/**
