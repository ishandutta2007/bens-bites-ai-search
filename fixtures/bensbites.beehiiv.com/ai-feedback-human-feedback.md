Hello folks, today, I’m**interviewing the founder of Glean**, an AI-powered workplace search, that has raised over $100M at a $1Bn valuation, backed by Sequoia, BoxGroup General Catalyst, Lightspeed, Kleiner Perkins and more. It was founded in 2019. Post your[question suggestions here.](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1699039135334285583?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-feedback-human-feedback)

Here’s what we have today;

##### <mark>**Our picks**</mark>

**1/**

**Researchers from Google**compared reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to[reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00267?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-feedback-human-feedback). Human evaluators preferred the RLHF and RLAIF outputs over the base model ones around 70% of the time. But the interesting part is that both techniques led to equal improvements. That means**RLAIF can achieve human-level performance**and address the scalability issues of RLHF.

[X’s privacy policy confirms it will use public data to train AI models](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/01/xs-privacy-policy-confirms-it-will-use-public-data-to-train-ai-models/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-feedback-human-feedback). Some privacy policy changes on X (rip Twitter) say that now they will\*\*use the user data to train machine learning models.\*\*Elon has said he’ll use public tweets for X AI, so no surprise there. However, he can back out of it by saying we meant improving our algorithm, not training LLMs (like Zoom did).

**3/**

[Mustafa Suleyman on getting Washington and Silicon Valley to tame AI.](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/mustafa-suleyman-getting-washington-and-silicon-valley-to-tame-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-feedback-human-feedback)Mustafa mentions that a few of the**voluntary commitments**top AI firms made with the White House last month should be legally mandatory. He also makes his case**against open-sourcing AI models.**
