# AI improves breast cancer detection

New research shows[AI can improve breast cancer detection rates](https://www.ft.com/content/d3b462a3-8085-43d7-9e37-a78564907d2c?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-improves-breast-cancer-detection) compared to human radiologists alone.

## What's going on here?

AI analysis caught 13% more breast cancers than radiologists in a study of 25,000 mammograms, proving it's an effective safety net.

## What does that mean?

The AI tools called Mia spotted cancers radiologists missed, demonstrating it complements human expertise. The research let radiologists use the tool in three different ways, resulting in 5%, 10% and 13% more detections. The additional flags identified invasive cancers that are likely to spread, i.e. it has life-saving potential.

AI addition also made the diagnosis process 45% faster. Mia is being used at 16 hospitals in the UK and is being rolled out in the US.

## Why should I care?

Missed breast cancers cause avoidable death and suffering. AI offers a solution to improve detection worldwide. You should welcome new tech if it catches disease sooner when treatment is more successful.

With faster diagnosis, doctors can also cater to a larger population. Using AI as an additional tool with the radiologists in the loop can give patients reassurance. Still, more work can be done to show how AI reaches decisions before fully trusting it.
