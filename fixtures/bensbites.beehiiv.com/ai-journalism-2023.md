# AI is changing journalismâ€”faster than you think.

[A survey by JournalismAI](https://www.journalismai.info/research/2023-generating-change?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-is-changing-journalism-faster-than-you-think) examines how 105 newsrooms across 46 countries are using AI in news gathering, production and distribution.

## What's going on here?

Wide AI adoption is uneven and challenging. Over 75% of respondents use AI in news gathering, production or distribution, but only a third have an AI strategy.

## What does this mean?

Efficiency and freeing up journalists are the main drivers of AI adoption (over 50%). But only 1/3 feel fully ready to handle AI adoption challenges like explaining AI, setting guidelines, and debiasing algorithms. More than 60% are concerned about the ethical implications of AI integration. 80% expect AI's role to grow, influencing fact-checking, content generation, personalization and sentiment analysis.

Organizations worry AI could hurt smaller, lesser-resourced newsrooms. The two key barriers are technical difficulties (41%) and ethical challenges (25%).

## Why should I care?

AI is changing journalism, but realizing its potential requires balancing tech and ethics. Targeted training, sharing between organizations and addressing challenges like bias and transparency are critical. The opportunities are vast, but so are the risks if adoption is uneven or overly profit-driven. Collaborative efforts to spread AI capabilities while prioritizing journalistic values are essential as this technology reshapes news.
