Hello folks, here’s what we have today;

##### <mark>**Our picks**</mark>

**1/**

[**Superhuman AI launches today**](https://blog.superhuman.com/superhuman-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-website-generators)

I use Superhuman as my default email app (have for years!) and now they’ve launched their AI features. Write emails in your voice, summarise a long conversation and even do research in your email (instead of switching apps to ChatGPT) - plus translation, editing etc too. (not an ad!)

**I love it**. So does a friend of Ben’s Bites, Dan Shipper, as he wrote[here](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/ai-can-do-my-email-now?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-website-generators).

[Wix’s AI Site Generator lets you describe what you want in a prompt](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/wixs-new-tool-can-create-entire-websites-from-prompts/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-website-generators)and generates a home page, inner pages, text, images, and biz-specific sections. It combines a mixture of**ChatGPT for text and in-house models for styyyyle.**

I personally believe that AI website generators are in a passing phase. The real marvel would be entirely new web experiences created with AI.

Figure is a startup competing in the robot space that we’ve mentioned a few times, and[they’ve just received a $9m backing from Intel](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/intel-backs-figures-humanoid-robot-to-the-tune-of-9-million/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-website-generators)- a pretty strong vote of confidence! The humanoid robot took its first steps this week, and**its focus is the industrial warehouse**side of the labour economy, a business aspect that Intel views as the future of the robotics industry.

According to the cofounder of DeepMind,[the UK doesn’t seem to have enough gumption to achieve its AI superpower dreams](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-66166236?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-website-generators). Despite the gov providing**£1B in AI-related funding**, he says that the risk-taking culture present in the US that’ll allow tech startups to thrive,**take risks, celebrate failures**, and pull in mega tech funding rounds. I just reckon they need to put the Ben’s Bites team in charge, but that’s just me…
