We‚Äôve all heard about AI writing tools. (I‚Äôm an investor in [Lex](http://lex.page?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend), which is a great one)

But the trend for ‚ÄòAI writing‚Äô as a whole is HUGE. (10x the search volume)

One writing tool, [Jenni](https://jenni.ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend), changed its focus to students and writing research papers. It‚Äôs made $2M (the bulk in the last 9 months). They have a small team (less than 10), all bootstrapped.

And it‚Äôs essentially an AI writing tool with some specific features for its niche (citations, research library etc)

Look at the website focus from a year ago to now:

And [focusing on short-form](https://x.com/Davidjpark96/status/1706019242766962928?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend) platforms bringing in millions of views.

[Adding simple features](https://x.com/Davidjpark96/status/1668336661330272258?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend) users will like helped retain hundreds of customers. (plus students don‚Äôt want to pay over summer break!)

Being smart about what would [reduce churn](https://x.com/Davidjpark96/status/1647666691881730049?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend).

There are already plenty of SEO-AI tools out there, which are making money until Google‚Äôs algorithm can figure out if they‚Äôve been written with AI (they can‚Äôt really right now).

AI writing is here to stay. So what are the opportunities?

#### Opportunities:

Courses are a big one. You could create a course around how to use AI to write for a specific niche. People sign up for tools all the time thinking it‚Äôll solve their problems but you still need to know a bunch of stuff before the tool makes your writing good. So how do I use the tool? What are the right tools? How do I get it to write in the style I want? I‚Äôm a gardener, how do I write for other gardeners? Etc.

- A cool way to do a course here could be to ask users to use AI to come up with a short post idea on a topic they know, write the post with AI as your copilot (because they would anyway), but then use AI as a way to improve it - have your favourite writers simulated by AI to give you feedback, suggestions, rewrite it in 4 different styles and 3 different lengths. The output would be all of these things instead of an AI-generated blog post. you‚Äôd be teaching people how to write, with AI as your helpful editor.

A newsletter breaking down great copy, analysing it with AI to see what it does well and where it could improve. Sam Parr has a course, [copythat](https://copythat.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend), which looks at great writing and you copy it to learn the techniques behind the posts.

Nicholas Cole has a ‚Äò[Write with AI](https://writewithai.substack.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend)‚Äô paid newsletter that teaches you to use AI to write. You can do this for all different types of copywriting - focus on sales emails, product copy, personal journaling etc.

AI writing tools. Given there are so many, you could review each one, do a write-up, give them a score and get paid from ads or affiliates by linking to the tools. Similar to [Site Builder Report](https://www.sitebuilderreport.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend) - which reviews website builders.

Create a site of beautiful product copy that people can copy and remix using AI. Did you know [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend) (a site for searching and copying an emoji) sold for $7M?!!

Simple tools that generate text from images - I‚Äôve seen people upload an AI image and ask ‚Äúfrom the image, create a detailed prompt that could be used to create a similar image‚Äù - this is a great hack to find great prompts, but also a system for making a simple tool. Use it for product descriptions, reverse script writing, producing product documentation etc.

Build a tool to A/B test your copy with AI-suggested improvements. [Thumbnailtest.com](http://Thumbnailtest.com?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend) does this for, you guessed it, testing thumbnails. And [made $20K last month](https://x.com/RoxCodes/status/1728204610685612470?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-writing-a-trend).

Build a tool for podcasters to take their transcription and turn it into a timestamped description, with product links mentioned, when they‚Äôre mentioned and what they do. Turn that transcript into a tweet, a blog post etc.
