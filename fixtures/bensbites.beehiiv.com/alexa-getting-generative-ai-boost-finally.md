# Alexa is getting generative AI boost, finally.

Amazon announced new [generative AI capabilities for Alexa](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/20/amazon-brings-generative-ai-to-alexa?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=alexa-is-getting-generative-ai-boost-finally) that will power more conversational and personalized experiences. The new generative AI model will allow Alexa to have **more dynamic conversations**that respond to cues like **body language and vocal tone.**

## What's going on here?

Amazon is bringing more advanced AI to Alexa to enable more natural conversations.

## What does this mean?

Alexa will be able to tap into APIs to control smart home devices based on abstract descriptions. It will also exhibit a more robust personality informed by user preferences and history. For example, it may recommend recipes based on past grocery purchases. The AI can also dynamically adjust its tone to express emotions like excitement and laughter. This should lead to richer, more free-flowing conversations compared to Alexa's more rigid responses previously.

## Why should I care?

This update brings Alexa closer to Amazonâ€™s vision of an intelligent assistant you can chat with conversationally. The adaptability and expanded memory will make interactions feel more natural. This could be a major step toward mainstream adoption of voice assistants beyond simple commands. Of course, the actual experience remains to be seen, but it may finally live up to the promise of an AI assistant that knows you and can hold contextual conversations.
