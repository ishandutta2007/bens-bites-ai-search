[AWS launched Amazon Bedrock](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230928577730/en/AWS-Announces-Powerful-New-Offerings-to-Accelerate-Generative-AI-Innovation?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=amazon-is-back-in-the-ai-game), a fully managed AI service giving access to top foundation models, plus other tools to build customized AI apps.

**What does this mean?**

Amazon Bedrock lets companies easily experiment with leading AI models like Anthropic's Claude and Meta‚Äôs Llama 2 through a single API. It simplifies development so companies can focus on creating differentiated AI solutions. Bedrock also helps companies customize models with their own data privately and securely.

Amazon Titan Embeddings model is a new addition to their suite of homegrown models. Amazon CodeWhisperer is getting an enterprise tier with code auto-complete using companies' private code. Amazon Quicksight is evolving into a generative BI platform with natural language data queries.

**Why should I care?**

Bedrock‚Äôs goal is to save Amazon‚Äôs position as the top cloud provider. With it Amazon‚Äôs trying to cement AWS as a one-stop AI shop. With their own coding and embedding models, they might have an edge over Microsoft which is offering OpenAI models on Azure and paying a hefty fee.

[Venture firms are using their connections](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/vcs-dangle-ai-chips-to-woo-founders?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=amazon-is-back-in-the-ai-game)at Amazon, Microsoft, Google, and others to get AI startups preferential access to limited GPU chips.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8b9d8859-e556-4d8f-9f1c-2a2c81cff284/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

Firms like Greylock, Madrona, and Bessemer have been instrumental in helping their portfolio companies like Adept, Inflection, and Laredo Labs land deals for thousands of Nvidia GPUs from cloud providers. This allows startups developing AI models to bypass waits and secure the specialized hardware they need.

**Why should I care?**

The VC relationships are providing a competitive advantage to their portfolio companies in the race to build cutting-edge AI. Given the current supply constraints on chips, startups not backed by top-tier VC firms can face debilitating delays in getting access.
