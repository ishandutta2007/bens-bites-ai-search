## What does this mean?

Amazon Bedrock lets companies easily experiment with leading AI models like Anthropic's Claude and Meta’s Llama 2 through a single API. It simplifies development so companies can focus on creating differentiated AI solutions. Bedrock also helps companies customize models with their own data privately and securely. Amazon Titan Embeddings model is a new addition to their suite of home grown models. Amazon CodeWhisperer is getting an enterprise tier with code auto-complete using companies' private code. Amazon Quicksight is evolving into a generative BI platform with natural language data queries.

## Why should I care?

Bedrock’s goal is to save Amazon’s position as the top cloud provider. With it Amazon’s trying to cement AWS as a one-stop AI shop. With their own coding and embedding models, they might have an edge over Microsoft which is offering OpenAI models on Azure and paying a hefty fee.
