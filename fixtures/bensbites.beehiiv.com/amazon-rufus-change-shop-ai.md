# Amazon Rufus is about change how you shop, with AI.

[Amazon's beta testing out Rufus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=amazon-rufus-is-about-change-how-you-shop-with-ai), an AI assistant designed to make shopping on its app smooth. It's like having a personal shopping buddy in your pocket, trained on Amazon's vast product universe and a sprinkle of web wisdom.

## What's going on here?

Amazon is about to launch an ecommerce chatbot called Rufus.

## What does this mean?

Rufus is here to change how we shop on Amazon, making it more interactive and intuitive. The most important of these is answering questions based on a specific product. Rufus will generate answers based on listing details, customer reviews, and community Q\&As to tell you if a product meets your requirements.

Just like any other chatbot, Rufus is also designed to help with:

- **Pre-purchase information:** It’ll answer questions like, “what to consider when buying headphones?”

- **Use case based purchases:** Want to plan an event? Ask Rufus what you need to buy.

- **Compare product categories:** Go deep in the weeds to figure out the difference between trail vs. road running shoes.

- **Gifting ideas:** How can we forget the classic LLM chatbot example—“What do I get her for Valentine’s day”, right?

But Rufus is not just another chatbot; it's a shopping specialist. It’s built on unique data from retail stores, it digs into customer reviews, Q\&As, and the web to find exactly what you need. Rufus would support voice or chat interactions, i.e. type away or talk; Rufus listens.

## Why should I care?

I’m bullish on large companies using LLMs to solve tiny use cases (alongside going for big bets). I like the recent upgrade in Amazon reviews where comments are grouped according to the sentiment. It does get some things wrong, but navigating a few categories instead of individual comments makes it easier.

I bet it’ll take some time for Rufus to make its way to everyone, as this is just a beta launch in the US but I’m excited to see if it can help in making shopping any better.
