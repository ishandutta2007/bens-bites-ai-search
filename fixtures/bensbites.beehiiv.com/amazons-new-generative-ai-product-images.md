## What does this mean?

The new image generation tool leverages AI to automatically create lifestyle photos featuring products, removing a key creative barrier for many advertisers. For example, placing a toaster in a kitchen scene rather than on a white background lifts click-through rates 40%. This helps brands of all sizes, whether they lack creative capabilities or just want added efficiency. Users simply pick a product, click "Generate" and the tool outputs brand-themed lifestyle images in seconds.

## Why should I care?

This free tool makes producing great creative assets easy for any advertiser. More compelling ads lead to better campaign results. It's a perfect application of AI - less work for better outcomes.

The tool needs no technical expertise. In the Amazon Ads Console, you select a product and then click "Generate" to get lifestyle images. You can refine images by entering text prompts and quickly test multiple versions to optimize performance.

Amazon surveyed advertisers and found creative production was a top challenge, so this new capability aims to remove friction. Data and AI have already boosted ad efficiency, but the art of great creativity remained difficult. Generative AI solves this.

With image generation, brands can efficiently develop differentiated and engaging creatives that make their ads stand out. Amazon will continue improving the tool based on feedback during the beta rollout. So all advertisers now have a simple way to make compelling visuals that drive more clicks and sales.
