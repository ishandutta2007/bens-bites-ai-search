## What does this mean?

Anthropic is working hard to make OpenAI-Microsoft partnership look small in terms of complexity. Here’s a quick timeline of partnerships for Anthropic:

Google’s been their partner from the early days with a significant share. Then comes Amazon investing $1.25B (can go up to $4B) into the startup with public announcements that Anthropic will move to AWS and Amazon chips heavily. We think Google’s been ditched.

Google invests $0.5B more (can go up to $2B). The situationship is still going on. And now we have claims that Anthropic will spend $3B with Google Cloud and also use their new TPU chips. deal. Dario Amodei, Anthropic’s CEO has made it clear: no plans for exclusivity, they’re all just friends with benefits (clouds).

## Why should I care?

Google always claims its TPU chips as a competitive strength. With clients like Anthropic, Hugging Face and AssemblyAI, that’s feeling more true than ever (especially when Google’s own LLM show hasn’t been that great).

Google says it’s chill with Anthropic shopping around. And for Anthropic, you can think of 100 other dating puns and it’ll still somehow make sense.
