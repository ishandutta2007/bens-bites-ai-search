[Anthropic has released Claude 2.1](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=anthropic-releases-claude-2-1), the latest version of its AI assistant, with several major upgrades including a 200,000 token context window, reduced rates of hallucination, and new tool use capabilities. So with the new chad in town, will you break up with OpenAI?

## What's going on here?

Anthropic has launched Claude 2.1, with a set of improvements over Claude 2.

## What does this mean?

200,000 tokens are equivalent to 500 pages of text, so you can fit all the messages you send to your ex. It’s also improving in using that big context window—2x fewer instances of hallucinating information. Anthropic calls this gains in honesty. Feels like your ex saying, “*Yes, baby, let’s get back together. I’ve made significant gains in honesty.”*

Claude 2.1 is also more accurate and reliable in its outputs—a 30% drop in incorrect answers and 3-4x lower rates of unsupported claims. In simple words, Claude will lie less and try not to gaslight you.

With API access, you can now also access extra tools via API, but the feature is in beta. Some more features in the developer console to top it all off: System prompts and a playground for testing prompts.

## Why should I care?

For enterprise users of Claude's API, version 2.1 brings the assistant to new levels of functionality with full documents. New tool integrations allow Claude to directly query databases, make API calls and more based on natural language requests.

Claude 2.1 is live on the free and pro plans but the increased context length is reserved for pro users.
