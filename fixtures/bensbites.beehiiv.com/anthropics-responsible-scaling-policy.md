# Anthropic's Responsible Scaling Policy

Anthropic published its [Responsible Scaling Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/index/anthropics-responsible-scaling-policy?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=anthropic-s-responsible-scaling-policy) to manage risks as AI becomes more capable. It includes a series of technical and organizational protocols they are adopting to help us manage the risks of developing increasingly capable AI systems.

## What's going on here?

Anthropic introduced a framework called AI Safety Levels to target catastrophic risks from misuse as AI advances.

## What does this mean?

The policy defines safety requirements at higher AI Safety Levels. Current models like Claude are Level 2, requiring security measures. Future Level 3 models may show dangerous capabilities, so Anthropic won't deploy them until safety is proven through red team testing. This balances safety and beneficial progress.

## Why should I care?

This policy matters because advanced AI holds risks if misused. Anthropic's framework provides a model for other companies and policymakers looking to develop AI safely. While not perfect, it explains the risk of AI models without going all doom and gloom. We need more companies thoughtfully addressing safety.
