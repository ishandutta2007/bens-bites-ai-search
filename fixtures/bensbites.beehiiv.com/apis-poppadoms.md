It's Friday! (don't you hate it when people say 'Happy Friday' or even worse, 'Fri*yay*'). Anyway, since you didn't ask, I'm going out for a 'Modern Indian' tonight and the menu has as many choices as I offer here. I want everything. As for poppadoms, I'm a shard guy. No smashing them here folks.

Welcome to the 145 new folks joining us since yesterday. Fancy some AI treats?! Indulge below. And have a bloody lovely weekend while you're at it!

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

You can now integrate DALL¬∑E directly into your apps and products through the API. [**DALL¬∑E API is now available**](https://openai.com/blog/dall-e-api-now-available-in-public-beta/) in a public beta. The API documentation is [here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/images/usage). Extra coverage by The Verge [here](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/3/23438604/text-to-image-ai-openai-dall-e-api-public-beta-price).
