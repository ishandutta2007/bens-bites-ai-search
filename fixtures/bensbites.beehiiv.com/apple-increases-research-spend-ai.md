Hello folks, here’s what we have today;

Tim Cook insists that[Apple produces just as much AI tech as everyone else](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/apple-ai-artificial-intelligence-tim-cook-iphone-b2387879.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=apple-increases-research-spend-in-ai).We’re all acutely aware of how quiet Apple has been with the AI wave. Tim says**AI forms a core part of all of Apple’s technology**, and AI continues to grow within its R\&D business strategy.

Another report from FT mentions[Apple bringing generative AI on mobile devices](https://www.ft.com/content/d74477b6-8355-42a9-ae37-7c835880ef9e?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=apple-increases-research-spend-in-ai)based on job advertisements. Just cos they don’t have an AI-pal doesn’t mean they’re not involved…

[Salesforce has landed a new product on the scene](https://techcrunch.com/2023/08/04/salesforce-einstein-studio-lets-you-bring-your-own-model-starting-with-amazon-sagemaker/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=apple-increases-research-spend-in-ai), and it’s called**Einstein Studio**, coupled with BYOM (Bring Your Own Model - not Booze I’m afraid!) The idea is that you can**bring your own models into Salesforce’s Data Cloud**to mix it with Salesforce data, use gen AI to get insights on your data, and trigger actions within the Studio, such as sending emails. It support Amazon Sagemaker integration, and Google Vertex AI is coming soon.

Whilst autonomous vehicles have struggled to really take off in the West, it’s looking like a different story in the East. In China,[Toyota has grand plans to mass produce their robotaxis](https://www.reuters.com/technology/toyota-chinas-ponyai-set-up-jv-with-139-mln-investment-2023-08-04/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=apple-increases-research-spend-in-ai)using autonomous vehicle tech developed with Pony.ai. With a\*\*total $140m investment,\*\*the already-mature tech will get taken to the next level and deployed across the country.

**4/**

[There’s a new crawler in town - Open AI’s GPTbot](https://platform.openai.com/docs/gptbot?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=apple-increases-research-spend-in-ai). Websites can now**disallow GPTbot to crawl their website**or a section of it (like robots.txt). Is Open AI finally on the data hunt for GPT-5?
