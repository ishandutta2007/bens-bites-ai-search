# Arrakis is deserted

[OpenAI recently scrapped a new AI model called Arrakis](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-dropped-work-on-new-arrakis-ai-model-in-rare-setback?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=arrakis-is-deserted) after it failed to meet expectations. Arrakis was meant to allow OpenAI to run its AI systems more efficiently and cheaply.

## What's going on here?

OpenAI halted work on a model codenamed Arrakis this spring after realizing the model underperformed and did not deliver the expected cost savings.

## What does this mean?

While not immediately impacting OpenAI's business, it may slow future progress as engineers shift focus. Microsoft, an OpenAI partner, was also hoping to use Arrakis to lower costs, so this delays their integration plans. Open AI researchers have since pivoted to making GPT-4 faster with hopes of a model termed GPT-4 Turbo (which could’ve been Arrakis’ final name, if continued).

Arrakis was meant to use a technique called sparsity. Google’s Jeff Dean has also referred to sparsity as an important trend looking ahead.

## Why should I care?

The Arrakis news highlights the complexity of pushing AI forward. There are no guarantees, even for the most capable companies. The delay caused by the Arrakis project could mean that other companies like Google and Anthropic might catch up to Open AI soon.
