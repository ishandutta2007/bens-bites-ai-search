Hello and welcome to the 1,299 new folks joining us since last week. An uneventful one for me this weekend, a christening (where I became a Godfather for the 4th time üò≥), dog walks and food!

Getting all my ducks in a row before I head off to Austin next week for the Zapier offsite üéâ . The email will go out as normal, there may be a couple of late sends but I'll try not to!

Let's get to it.

*p.s. [ChatGPT Pro is rolling out](https://twitter.com/chillzaza_/status/1616927021472354304) slowly for $42/mo. They promise more uptime, faster speeds and priority access to new features. I keep refreshing but I don't have the option yet!*

### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

It was about 50% of the way in that the two parties realised they were defining AGI differently, and they each received more compliments than my wife has given me in the last 5 years. Nevertheless, [**this debate**](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/agi-will-not-happen-in-your-lifetime)**between IBM Fellow Grady Booch and NYU Prof. Gary Marcus** is brilliantly insightful, helps us to realise that the **focus on LLMs is actually** ***stunting*** **AGI** development, and explains why **lack of plasticity across domains** is a major setback for AGI development.

A good point is being made here. Once you appreciate that true AGI needs to encapsulate everything from metacognition to sentience in order to truly infer and transfer knowledge across domains, the focus on incremental improvements in LLMs is perhaps **directing money in a wonky, inefficient direction** that could put a stiff upper bound on our ability to achieve AGI.

#### 2/

Are Google sacking everyone to make money for new lawyers? My Twitter feed of **newly-unemployed techies** combined with [**this NYT article**](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/20/technology/google-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html) suggests so. Larry and Sergey are back, baby, well...kinda. Following their **‚ÄúCode Red‚Äù** business warning after OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT success, they‚Äôve said that they‚Äôll be **rethinking their risk capabilities** in order to get products to market quicker in order to leap-frog the competition. Given their social footprint, releases like this will invite much **more regulatory scrutiny** than OpenAI, and rightly so.

The announcement is quite disconcerting - reducing risk capabilities at one of the biggest players in the market in an **unpredictable and largely unknown field** with serious **societal consequences** seems dodgy at best, and negligent at worst. On the plus side, who wouldn‚Äôt want a Google/ChatGPT hybrid for a search engine?! I know I certainly would. Or even better, just a bit of big-tech-money competition!

#### 3/

And whilst we‚Äôre on ChatGPT: if you **need to pass an exam**, why not give it a try? It managed to [**get a decent score**](https://www.ft.com/content/7229ba86-142a-49f6-9821-f55c07536b7c) on one of Wharton‚Äôs core MBA modules, and also [**passed the US Medical Licensing Exam**](https://twitter.com/noor_siddiqui_/status/1617194845810077697), which people study for *years* to complete. I‚Äôm concerned that a knee-jerk reaction to these reports will be to use more in-house exam-based testing, further encouraging the study-to-pass attitude that‚Äôs currently damaging much of the education system. Better approaches might be to assess based on in-class interactions, workshops, or **longer-form reports where good use of AI technologies could actually be show-cased**.

#### 4/

\*\*Scale AI hosted its AI hackathon on Sunday.\*\*Some say it was the first time they physically felt 'Silicon Valley' in a while. Here are some tools that came out of it:

**Do you spend hours a day reading and writing?**\
I do (mostly for Ben's Bites!). To help put this email together, I use **[Bearly AI](https://bearly.ai/?ref=bensbites)** and its powerful article and video summary tools.\
Bearly also offers AI writing (rewording, grammar) and art (DALL-E) tools.\
All in one easy-to-use Desktop app. (I use the Chrome extension a lot too)\
