I swapped some of the sections around a bit. (The newsletter version of changing the button colours of your website). It's busy-work and we all do it. So don't look at me like that. It definitely, possibly, could make a huge difference okay?!

Let's get to it!

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

The least shocking news of the year so far: **Microsoft using GPT power for Bing**.

Did you know that **Microsoft's investment in OpenAI included a little clause to slide some of GPT's magic into Bing**? And it's already incorporating DALL-E into Bing's image creator tool.

So, yeah, Microsoft is preparing to launch a version of its Bing search engine with a little splash of GPT powering it. It'll help users answer search queries rather than just showing a list of links (plus 5 million ads to avoid).

Now I, like you, have never used Bing, but if it were to have ChatGPT-like powers behind the scenes, I may take a little trip over to their site and give it a go. New Year, new me and all that.

Google's code 'really really red' is just about to kick off and we'll see what this year has in store for us. **Microsoft vs Google, The AI wars**. Sounds like an AI created movie.

**This Detroit startup aims to shape the future of video creation with AI (Sponsor).**\
Small Michigan startup Waymark is trying to break down barriers to video creation with the help of AI. With Waymark, users just type in basic information, and a team of AI models generates a complete marketing video for them in minutes. It looks like this approach is already picking up steam - Waymark has a few enterprise clients under its belt and has been listed in both Hulu and Roku's creative directories.\

### **ü§ì Miscellaneous**

- **Language styling made as accessible as text formatting** using GPT-3. ([link](https://twitter.com/zats/status/1609881792026218496))
- Does the textual corpus for large language models have **enough information to train an AGI**? This article discusses two hypotheses about whether LLMs are sufficient to progress to general AI, and the lack of consensus among experts on the potential of these models. ([link](https://shakoist.substack.com/p/does-the-textual-corpus-for-large))
- **LLM uncanny valley hypothesis**. Basically, as AI gets smarter, it'll get slower and more expensive to use. And since it'll only be used for super complicated stuff, humans will have a lower tolerance for mistakes. So if an AI almost gets it right, but not quite, it'll be a huge pain for humans to fix it. It's like an 'uncanny valley' for AI - we don't know when it'll start happening or when it'll end. But hey, at least right now AI is cheap and powerful enough to be useful to lots of people.
