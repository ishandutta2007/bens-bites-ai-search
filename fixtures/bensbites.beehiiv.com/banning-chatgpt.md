Hello and welcome to the 2,151 new readers joining since last week. This is Ben's Bites.

Hope you all had a great weekend. My parents visited so lots of eating and drinking was involved. My highlight? My dad confidently saying "Drop Mic" instead of "Mic drop". He tried so hard to get a recent reference in and tripped at the finish line.

Let's get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

I built a simple tool for email. Get **emails summarised and a draft reply written**, using AI. I saw a tweet that was asking for this and knew it could be done with Zapier + OpenAI so I built it in like 10 minutes. You could build this out and make it better or more accurate but it's a great step. I may do similar for organising my emails too. ([link](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1614583964282281984))

I'm loving how much Dan Shipper is diving into AI and running a bunch of experiments. "**GPT-3 is the best journal** I‚Äôve ever used". Some key takeaways: GPT-3 can be used to create a written record, and can provide support similar to that of an empathic friend, Chatbots can be great for journaling, as they can help you get your thoughts out of your head, increase self-awareness, and create a record of your journey, and GPT-3 can be used to take on the persona of a compassionate figure, or to act as a bot well-versed in various therapy modalities.

#### 3/

**"Don‚Äôt ban ChatGPT** in schools. Teach with it." A new article from the New York Times looking into the recent debate around AI and students. Personally I think it's just a new thing that people don't understand fully, so they're scared. Schools should definitely embrace this and try and include it in their lessons. Kids will always have access to these tools through their phones, denying its existence and ignoring its potential would be like not allowing kids to use computers in school.
