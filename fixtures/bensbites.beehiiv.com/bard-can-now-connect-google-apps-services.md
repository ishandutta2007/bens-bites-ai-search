Gmail and Drive for work. And the good old YouTube.

- **Double Check**: You can now click the lil’ \[G] button after a Bard answer to “Google it,” and it’ll **highlight parts of the answer** in Green and Red based on info on Google.

You can also continue shared chats now, and they have upgraded the version of LLM underlying Bard, but it’s still PaLM 2 (not Gemini).

## What does this mean?

Bard can now hook into your Google stuff like Gmail, Docs and Maps to give you personalized responses based on your own data. There's a new "Google it" button so you can double-check anything Bard says using regular Google Search. Bard now works in 40+ languages and has a fancier AI brain so its answers should be higher quality. Basically, Google is turning Bard into a real personal assistant that can help you get things done by tying it into the Google tools you already use all the time.

## Why should I care?

These new features make Bard so much more helpful as a virtual assistant. It can tap into your own Google account to give you customized responses for planning trips, writing docs, and anything else you need a hand with. The ability to fact-check Bard's answers helps you trust what it says. More languages and a smarter AI mean Bard will just keep getting better at conversing. This is a big step toward Bard becoming that AI sidekick that can make your life easier and more productive.
