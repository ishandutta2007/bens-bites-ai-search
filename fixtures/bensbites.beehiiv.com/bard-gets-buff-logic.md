Hey folks, today we have a bunch from Google: Google Cloud consulting is expanding, Gen AI is open in Google Vertex, and a partnership with Salesforce. Then the Bard boy is getting smarter under the hoods.t

Deepmind (another Google baby) is finding new algorithms. Microsoft is getting the governments to try out AI and OpenAI is not training GPT-5 yet.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

ü§åOur Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[Google Cloud Services offer consultants](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/google-launches-new-learning-and-consulting-offers-help-enterprises-on-their-ai-journey/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-gets-a-buff-in-its-logic)and[a Salesforce partnership](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/google-cloud-and-salesforce-team-up-to-bolster-ai-offerings/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-gets-a-buff-in-its-logic)

**Google** **Cloud**hit the tape a bit throughout the day yesterday, so they‚Äôre getting a pick all to themselves.

One that plenty of you will enjoy hearing is their**Cloud Consulting**offering is expanding. There‚Äôs high-touch training for the folk in the C-suite, as well as on-demand learning paths and credentials for everyone else to get hands-on experience in the AI arena. Oh, and[generative AI support in Vertex AI](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/googles-generative-ai-support-in-vertex-ai-is-now-generally-available/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-gets-a-buff-in-its-logic), the company‚Äôs machine learning platform, is now generally available.

Next up, there‚Äôs a case of two companies realising the other has better stuff‚Ä¶**Salesforce** **and Google**will offer both companies‚Äô AI products as part of a single package. (For the techies out there, this package has Google‚Äôs BigQuery, Vertex AI, and Salesforce‚Äôs Data Cloud.) Salesforce gets more data tools, and Google gets 150,000 orgs to sell to.

The central theme seems to be Google‚Äôs push towards serving large enterprises to make money, which is surprising because last year, only 10% of revenue was from Google Cloud.

**2/**

[DeepMind applies game-winning AI to other domains with great success](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/deepmind-repurposes-game-playing-ais-to-optimize-code-and-infrastructure/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-gets-a-buff-in-its-logic)

Remember**AlphaZero**, that**DeepMind**AI that started dominating the world of games like Go and Chess? The Alpha series is back at it, but this time across all sorts of other tasks.

For starters, the same AlphaZero is analysing data centres and allocating resources*wayyy*more efficiently (20% in fact). Another MuZero is compressing YouTube videos by about 4% (that‚Äôs big).

But the star is[AlphaDev which discovered faster sorting algorithms](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphadev-discovers-faster-sorting-algorithms?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-gets-a-buff-in-its-logic)from a completely new approach. It didn‚Äôt look to optimise existing algorithms and I believe that‚Äôs what we all need to do with AI. Think from scratch from an AI-first perspective.

**3/**

[Microsoft offer GPT-3 and GPT-4 to government Azure users](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-07/microsoft-offers-powerful-openai-technology-to-us-government-cloud-customers?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-gets-a-buff-in-its-logic)

Enough about Google, I had no idea there‚Äôs a**Microsoft** **Azure**offering solely for the government, and it looks like they‚Äôre getting a boost ahead of everyone else! Anyway, Microsoft is offering up OpenAI‚Äôs**GPT-3 and GPT-4** **to all users of the Azure Government cloud**computing service, which is chocka-block with US government agencies. This is actually a great move in the right direction to nudge clunky government agencies into the cutting edge and help them to develop in the way they should be.

**4/**

[OpenAI say it hasn‚Äôt started training GPT-5 yet](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/07/openai-gpt5-sam-altman/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-gets-a-buff-in-its-logic)

There‚Äôs been a hell of a lot of hand-waving over the past few months in an effort to slow the development of AI, with worries that we‚Äôll end up accidentally creating something that‚Äôll wipe us all out. The ‚ÄúAI doomers‚Äù (as they‚Äôre often called) will be glad to hear that**OpenAI**CEO Sam Altman has said that it**hasn‚Äôt even started training the next stage of ChatGPT, GPT-5**. But that doesn‚Äôt mean there aren‚Äôt plans‚Ä¶ He also said that ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre working on the new ideas that we think we need for it.‚Äù Ominous‚Ä¶ we trust Big Sam, right? Right?

[Google Bard is improving and outputs can be exported to Google Sheets](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-improved-reasoning-google-sheets-export/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-gets-a-buff-in-its-logic)

Blimey,**Google**are getting a shed load of attention today - this time it‚Äôs all about**Bard**(their ChatGPT equivalent) and some self-proclaimed improvements‚Ä¶ One of the typical problems with these chatbots is that they struggle with maths, word manipulation, and logical reasoning, and Google reckons theirs is**making big improvements in all areas**. It‚Äôs coding in the backend to improve its logic power. Ask it to reverse the word ‚Äúlollipop‚Äù and it‚Äôll do it. Give it a riddle and it‚Äôll solve it. But I‚Äôll leave the experimenting to you guys - let us know how it holds up!
