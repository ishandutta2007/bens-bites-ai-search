# Big Announcements At Intel Innovation 2023

Intel made several big announcements at their [2023 Innovation event](https://www.crn.com/news/components-peripherals/6-big-announcements-at-intel-innovation-2023-from-288-core-cpu-to-ai-supercomputer?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=big-announcements-at-intel-innovation-2023) related to AI and computing, including **new CPUs launching in December**, a plan for a 288-core Xeon chip, and a deal to build an **AI supercomputer for Stability AI.** They're aiming to challenge Nvidia in AI with their CPUs, GPUs, and dedicated AI accelerators.

## What's going on here?

While Nvidia has dominated the AI chip space recently with its GPUs, Intel is determined to become a major player. Their strategy includes integrating AI acceleration into CPUs to complement discrete offerings like their Gaudi chips.

## What does this mean?

- Intelâ€™s Core Ultra (Meteor Lake) is launching on December 14th, featuring integrated AI acceleration with a neural processing unit.

- 5th-gen Xeon Scalable server processors will also launch on Dec. 14. Future generation will include a 288-core CPU (in 2024).

- Intel will build a large AI supercomputer with Xeon and Gaudi2 processors for Stability AI.

- Intel Developer Cloud platform is now available, giving access to the latest Intel chips. Project Strata, a commercial software platform for building edge infrastructure will come in 2024.

## Why should I care?

More competition from Intel versus just Nvidia should drive innovation faster. Intel is also offering developers a platform to access and build AI solutions. While Nvidia may still lead, Intel's major investments in AI-focused chips and infrastructure signal more choices for developers.
