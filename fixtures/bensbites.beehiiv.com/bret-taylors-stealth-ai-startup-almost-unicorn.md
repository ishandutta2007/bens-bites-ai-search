## What does this mean?

Taylor founded this AI startup with Clay Bavor, a former Google hotshot. Now, it is on the brink of hitting unicorn status with a cool nearly $1 billion valuation, thanks to Sequoia Capital leading a hefty $85 million investment round.

Benchmark led an early investment in the company last year and Sierra already has some significant traction. With big names like Taylor and Bavor at the helm and Sequoia Capital opening its wallet, Sierra's one to watch. Taylor has already said that he’s with OpenAI for a short while—until the board situation sorts out. He’s got plans.

## Why should I care?

Taylor’s got a knack for leading and innovating—riding Salesforce's ups and Salesforce's downs, and now trying to stabilise OpenAI’s board. Such people can’t sit on the sidelines when AI is changing industries. Together with Bavor, Taylor is bringing that magic to Sierra.
