I'm back in the tutorial saddle! After so many people tweeted me about tutorials yesterday I thought I'd give it a go. (I built Makerpad, a no-code tutorial site).

Let me know what you think and any requests to do more, [on this tweet](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1597952558701895681).

Let's get into it.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- **I made a tutorial! How to build an AI app, without writing code, in 5 mins**. ([link](https://youtu.be/uh70rg99rvw)) I‚Äôd love it if you wanted to [share the tweet](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1597952558701895681) + reply there with any requests for more tutorials.

- **Stability AI has released its official API**. Why? Well, you can access the outputs by using a tool with a UI or knowing how to code to set it up yourself. So an API gives another way to access the outputs, you can plug them into spreadsheets with Zapier and plug them into an app much easier. ([link](https://api.stability.ai/docs))
- **Introducing GPT-JT, a 6B parameter open source model** that can outperform many 100B+ parameter models and was trained over slow (1Gbps) internet links. ([link](https://www.together.xyz/blog/releasing-v1-of-gpt-jt-powered-by-open-source-ai))
