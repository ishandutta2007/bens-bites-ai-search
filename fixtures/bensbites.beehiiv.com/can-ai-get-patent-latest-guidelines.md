# Can AI get a patent? \[Latest Guidelines Feb 2024]

**Can AI get a patent?** That's the question buzzing around tech. The US Patent Office (USPTO) just dropped some [guidelines](https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2024-02623.pdf?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=can-ai-get-a-patent-latest-guidelines-feb-2024) so we all know where things stand.

## What’s going on here?

The USPTO says only humans can be inventors and get patents. AI might be crazy smart, but it ain't legally a person.

## What does this mean?

Basically, it means that humans get the legal credit, with AI being like a super-advanced tool. Even if AI helps out, you need a human inventor on the patent to make it official.

You can't just tell the AI "make something cool" and claim the patent. You gotta actually contribute to the invention's development.

The USPTO also says that technology can lead to new laws and it will update standards to match changes if Congress modifies laws on AI.

## Why should I care?

This makes a big difference for all of us building with AI. If you're a founder working on AI-generated inventions, make sure you can prove your role in the process or there's no patent protection. For investors, the current stakes are clear—strong IP depends on the human driving the AI, not just the AI itself.
