- Six data and AI startups had valuation **multiples of 87.5X revenue** or more - The Information [**published their 2022 most promising startups**](https://www.theinformation.com/ti50?rc=bdorru).

It will also start selling AI-generated stock imagery with help from OpenAI.

- **[Robotic hands can basically solve a Rubik‚Äôs cube](https://dextreme.org/)**. That makes one of us.

- An argument for [**why VCs are making a big mistake investing in Generative AI**](https://twitter.com/WillManidis/status/1584900092615528448). Will argues that the best implementation of AI is in the boring menial tasks everyone has to do, and AI is very good at. Rather than everyone becoming a digital Picasso.

- Related: [A thread](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1584743837637160960) on the **speed of advancement in AI & how much of an impact that is going to have on many jobs**, soon.

- [Identifying objects in images](https://owlvit-tgc6as3cga-ew.a.run.app/). Google has released a simple and scalable approach for open-vocabulary object detection and image-conditioned detection. Using the demo is pretty fucking cool, in my opinion. Although, it struggled to find the cork...
