Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got Open AI‚Äôs next plan for ChatGPT privacy, governments experimenting with AI and Apple‚Äôs health assistant.

And then we have two not-so-underdogs, Huggingface and Replit, making splashes big waves.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[Apple to release an AI-powered health coach app called Quartz](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/apple-is-reportedly-developing-an-ai-powered-health-coaching-service/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure)

I dunno about you guys but that**Apple**health app on my iPhone is like a dormant volcano - doesn‚Äôt get opened until every few years when I decide to go on a run. Anyway, enough about me, because they‚Äôre planning to build out an AI-powered**health coach app**that they‚Äôre calling**Quartz**. The intention is to help users stay motivated to exercise, improve their eating habits, and sleep better using knowledge of their behaviour. It‚Äôll even be able to use Apple Watch feeds to**tailor personal programmes**. And if that‚Äôs not futuristic enough for you, they one day want to be able to use the app to understand the user‚Äôs mood and emotions‚Ä¶

[OpenAI are living up to their data protection promises](https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure)

If you‚Äôre like the Italians and object to**ChatGPT**for**data protection**reasons, then look no further my friend, because OpenAI is[embracing that shizz](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/openai-previews-business-plan-for-chatgpt-launches-new-privacy-controls/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure). They‚Äôre providing the option to**switch off your chat history**, which means that they won‚Äôt use your conversations to train future language models (or to improve current ones). Reuters have even gone and[named it](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-rolls-out-incognito-mode-chatgpt-2023-04-25/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure)\*\*‚Äúincognito mode.‚Äù\*\*And if you‚Äôre concerned that that‚Äôll hamper their ability to assess for abuse, then don‚Äôt fret - they hold onto it for 30 days to do exactly that.

PLUS: There‚Äôs a new business subscription coming soon that‚Äôll keep your inputs safe and private by default.

[UK government invest ¬£100m in a Sovereign AI machine](https://www.engadget.com/the-uk-government-wont-make-an-nft-after-all-125018638.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure)

It looks like the**UK government**is dipping its toes into AI again following that ¬£1B promise several months ago. This time they‚Äôre focussing on the idea of a\*\*‚Äòsovereign‚Äô AI\*\*getting a ¬£100m investment - I guess this is like a government-funded chatbot? It really is great to see governments embracing AI and seeing where it can be used to improve public services - we‚Äôve also seen the[US Congress sign](https://fedscoop.com/congress-gets-40-chatgpt-plus-licenses/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure)40 lucky sods up to ChatGPT+! I‚Äôm just hoping that the UK‚Äôs NFT promise during the peak of the crypto hype isn‚Äôt a bad omen for the AI industry

**4/**

[Hugging Face release their own AI chatbot named HuggingChat](https://huggingface.co/chat/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure)

Everyone‚Äôs favourite open-source platform,**Hugging Face**, hasn‚Äôt been able to resist the chance to get stuck in. They‚Äôve released**HuggingChat**(a natural name), their very own open-source chatbot with both a web interface and available API. Apparently it‚Äôs not quite up there with the language models of the big dogs, but hey, it‚Äôs free.

TechCrunch article[here](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/25/hugging-face-releases-its-own-version-of-chatgpt/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure).

[Replit becomes a unicorn and launches an open source code gen model.](https://www.semafor.com/article/04/25/2023/theres-a-new-ai-unicorn-that-will-make-coders-faster?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-becomes-more-secure)

Early in the day yesterday, Replit launched their series B extension raising $97.4M at a $1.16B valuation, and I knew something would be announced and it‚Äôs IRL gathering.

Later in the day, they launched a**code-gen model trained from scratch**that surpasses Open AI‚Äôs Codex with finetuning from Replit data. They are releasing the model under an open-source license too. Deets on the model size (it‚Äôs smol) and performance[here](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1650989632413401089).

Replit is something else these days. Lookout Github.
