##### <mark>**From the community**</mark>

We’re trying out some exclusive content, our first interview is with AI startup, Metal.

Founded in 2023,[Metal](https://getmetal.io/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-enterprise-new-exclusive-ben-s-bites-interview)is a platform and fully-managed service that helps developers build and implement production-grade large language model (LLM) applications. Its founders are Taylor Lowe, Sergio Prada and James O’Dwyer.

The team primarily services mid-market and enterprise-level companies that recognise the potential of LLMs, but don’t have the internal resources or expertise to integrate it into their tech stack. Working closely with their clients from start to finish, the Metal team provides consultation, ideation, development, education and support to help clients get the most value out of the technology.

### Company values

\*\*Find real value for customers.\*\*AI is a tool, and, like any tool, it works well for some things and doesn't work well for others. The task is to find the most valuable problems to solve, establish what customers stand to gain from a solution, then make owning that solution as frictionless as possible for the customer.

\*\*Be user-friendly.\*\*With the Metal platform comes many new concepts and a lot of new information for customers to learn. The average user is not an ML expert, so it’s important to make Metal as simple and approachable as possible—from the platform, to APIs, to documentation.

\*\*Always iterate.\*\*Continuous improvement > delayed perfection. AI is a fast-moving space, and uncovering the most value for customers lies at the frontiers of what’s currently possible with technology. Launching updates every day allows this to happen.

### Team

At the time of writing, Metal’s team consists of the three founders—Taylor, Sergio and James—and two engineers. Being a small startup, everyone wears many hats, but Taylor focuses on sales and marketing, Sergio works on the back-end technology with their founding engineer, and James handles the front-end and developer experience. Everyone is focused on product.

### Funding

Metal raised $2.5M in May 2023 and announced the raise in July 2023. Its lead investors are Swift Ventures, Y Combinator, and ChapterOne.

### Origin

The genesis of Metal goes back to 2019, when Taylor, Sergio and James were all working at the same startup in NYC and experienced first-hand how raw machine-learning (ML) technology was at the time.

Sergio and Taylor had been tasked with working on a new feature to classify support tickets using the recently launched[BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_\(language_model\)?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chatgpt-enterprise-new-exclusive-ben-s-bites-interview)family of language models.
