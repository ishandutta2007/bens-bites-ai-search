### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Chat to industry experts and historical figures with Delphi**](https://delphiai.substack.com/p/introducing-delphi)

If you could have dinner with any person, dead or alive, who would it be? Personally, I‚Äôd choose James Corden‚Ä¶ wait until he shouts at a waiter for no reason, and then give him a slap on the back of the wrist. Anyway, AI technology might be bringing this kind of question to life. [**Delphi**](https://delphiai.substack.com/p/introducing-delphi) is tuning **ChatGPT** technologies on the works of industry ‚Äútitans‚Äù and historical figures to produce **expert mentors** to chat with, **learn from**, and bounce ideas off.

Beyond being something cool, this actually opens up excellent opportunities for those who are unable to afford useful 1-on-1 mentoring, possibly making the usually inaccessible accessible to the masses.

**2/**

[**China‚Äôs version of Google is releasing a ChatGPT-style technology**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-30/chinese-search-giant-baidu-to-launch-chatgpt-style-bot-in-march)

The British Chinese are coming! The British Chinese are coming! China‚Äôs version of Google, **Baidu**, just [**announced their intention**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-30/chinese-search-giant-baidu-to-launch-chatgpt-style-bot-in-march) to release their equivalent of OpenAI‚Äôs **ChatGPT** and integrate it into their products - and it‚Äôll be as early as March! This is *big*newsthat raises a *big* question: If the media is censored in China, then is the model going to be trained on censored data? And if so, will it be able to respond with a personality that deviates from censorship despite this?

**3/**

[**Using NeRF for creative filmmaking shots**](https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1620118281393954818)

This **NeRF tech**is so damn cool, and I can‚Äôt wait to give it a try on my mobile. In [**this Tweet**](https://twitter.com/karenxcheng/status/1620118281393954818), Karen shows how you can create some kind of **morphing effect to the surroundings** of the object that you‚Äôre videoing. Pretty cool! Although, I have to say, I‚Äôll probably find it kind of embarrassing staying completely still whilst my friend walks around me with a camera in public‚Ä¶ In fact, I‚Äôll probably just keep it to myself at home for now.
