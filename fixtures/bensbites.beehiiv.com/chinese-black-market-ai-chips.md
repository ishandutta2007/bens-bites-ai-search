Hey folks, today we have funding news from Eleven Labs, the voice creation AI company.

Next up are two journo reports: one on the Chinese black market for AI chips and the second on the ‚Äúalleged‚Äù lobbying done by Open AI.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[Live Webinar: Leveraging Synthetic Data for Test Data Management](https://info.gretel.ai/en-us/webinar-leveraging-synthetic-data-for-test-data-management?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship\&utm_campaign=bensbites-20230621)

Testing and developing applications requires access to production data. However, distributing this data across lower environments or granting broad user access carries substantial privacy risks.

In this webinar, Gretel.ai explores the[role of synthetic data](https://info.gretel.ai/en-us/webinar-leveraging-synthetic-data-for-test-data-management?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=newsletter-sponsorship\&utm_campaign=bensbites-20230621)in providing safe access to production-grade data for testing and development.

- Anonymizing data to provide safe access in lower environments.

- Realistic unit testing with synthetic data.

- Conditional generation for scenario-based feature testing.

- Boosting small datasets for load and stress testing.

- Using data subsetting for shorter development cycles.

ü§åOur Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[ElevenLabs bag a 20m Series A for their voice creation AI](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/blog/elevenlabs-launches-new-generative-voice-ai-products-and-announces-19m-series-a-round-led-by-nat-friedman-daniel-gross-and-andreessen-horowitz/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chinese-black-market-for-ai-chips)

Ok I‚Äôll admit it, I spent many hours recording my own voice in my bedroom to make an**ElevenLabs**AI version of myself‚Ä¶ and it was damn good and totally weird .

Anyway, they‚Äôre back in the news again, and this time they‚Äôve landed a\*\*$19m Series A**to keep developing their**AI-generated personal voice tech\*\*. (For those who don‚Äôt know, these guys are at the forefront of turning clips of your voice into a fully-fledged AI version of it.) With the funding they aim to provide users with the ability to seamlessly generate entire dialogue segments, news articles, and even audiobooks without leaving the platform. They‚Äôve even got an**ElevenLabs voice detector**too‚Ä¶

**2/**

[The Chinese black market for NVIDIA computer chips](https://www.reuters.com/technology/inside-chinas-underground-market-high-end-nvidia-ai-chips-2023-06-19/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chinese-black-market-for-ai-chips)

I feel like I‚Äôm representing BBC Panorama with this one as a pick, but I‚Äôm loving the juiciness of it. Undercover journalists at Reuters have been getting stuck into the underground world of**NVIDIA computer chips in China**. Yep, you heard that right. Since US chip restrictions, a full on black market has emerged in China to advance AI, with startups and even well-positioned companies picking up NVIDIA A100s on the dark market.

**3/**

[Sam Altman‚Äôs European tour was one big lobbying trip](https://time.com/6288245/openai-eu-lobbying-ai-act/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chinese-black-market-for-ai-chips)

Aaahhh,**Sam Altman‚Äôs European pro-regulation escapade**is all starting to make sense now‚Ä¶ According to Time magazine, it was all one big**lobbying exercise**. Hardly a surprise really though, right?

As it turns out, during the development of the EU AI Act,**OpenAI**made a bunch of proposed changes that all ended up coming to fruition. One of the big moves from them was lobbying that their tech is general AI, and the regs should apply to AI for specific use-cases‚Ä¶ And guess what - it worked. The Act apparently doesn‚Äôt mention general intelligence tools like ChatGPT and Bard at all‚Ä¶

And in the meanwhile,[OpenAI is cooking up a marketplace](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-app-store-ai-software-information-2023-06-20/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=chinese-black-market-for-ai-chips)for developers to sell their AI models. I won‚Äôt be shocked if that‚Äôs true.
