**What does this mean?**

Workers AI allows developers to run popular AI models with just a few lines of code, without needing to manage infrastructure. It is powered by Cloudflare's global network of GPUs and provides curated pre-trained models like text generation, translation, image classification and more.

**Why should I care?**

This makes it incredibly simple for any developer to start building with AI, even with zero machine-learning expertise. Now you can deploy an AI-powered app in minutes. For those already using other services, Workers AI is platform-agnostic so you can still access it via API. Cloudflare is also prioritizing developer experience, privacy and global reach. The models are private by default, learning only from your prompts. Cloudflare plans to expand to 100 data centres this year for low latency worldwide. It's currently in open beta so developers can try it out and provide feedback to improve the product before launch.
