# Concentration of AI jobs needs intervention

[Geographical concentration of generative AI jobs isn’t going away on its own.](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-data-shows-that-without-intervention-generative-ai-jobs-will-continue-to-cluster-in-the-same-big-tech-hubs/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=concentration-of-ai-jobs-needs-intervention)The analysis comes from research by Brookings and other sources, shedding light on the narrative that AI could democratize tech geographically.

## What's going on here?

Despite the hype that generative AI could democratize tech across various regions, the reality is less rosy. Most AI jobs remain concentrated in a few key metro areas.

## What does this mean?

The stats are pretty eye-opening. Over 60% of generative AI jobs posted in the year ending in July 2023 are clustered in just 10 metro areas. More than a fifth of those are in the Bay Area alone. This mirrors earlier findings that over half of the nation’s AI activity in areas like federal contracting and startups were also focused in a few key regions, such as the Bay Area and 13 "early adopter" metro areas.

## Why should I care?

If you're gunning for a career in AI or planning a startup, this geographic bottleneck matters. It's not just about Silicon Valley hogging the limelight anymore; it's about real opportunities—or the lack thereof—in other places. But it’s not set in stone. Interventions like federal and state programs could still tilt the scales. Knowing where the jobs are (and aren’t) helps you strategize, whether you’re job hunting or policy-making.
