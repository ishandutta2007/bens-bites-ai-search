# Copilot to get specific button on keyboards

[Microsoft is introducing the first major change to PC keyboards in 30 years](https://www.axios.com/2024/01/04/microsoft-copilot-ai-button-windows?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=copilot-to-get-specific-button-on-keyboards) - a dedicated key for its AI assistant, Windows Copilot. Microsoft is confident that AI will be integral to the PC as we go ahead.

## What's going on here?

Microsoft sees AI as the next big shift in how people interact with computers and is baking it into Windows PCs via new hardware like the Copilot key.

## What does this mean?

The Copilot key replaces a menu button and will debut on new PCs announced at CES this week. Microsoft executive VP Yusuf Mehdi expects it will become standard on most new Windows machines by the end of 2023.

The new button will launch Copilot, allowing the new standard for AI—the simple language chatbox for everything. If you’ve disabled Copilot, it’ll open Windows search. Acc. to Mehdi, the goal is to reimagine the PC experience for the AI era (via Axios).

## Why should I care?

The addition of the Copilot key signals Microsoft believes AI is now mainstream enough for broad adoption. Apple’s M-series chips are currently thought of as the best playground for on-device AI. Although Microsoft is also talking about adding new chips with AI-specific processing power under the hood, changing the user behaviour with specific buttons could offload the disadvantage of cloud AI (if it is one).
