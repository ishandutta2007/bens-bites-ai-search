[Microsoft just jazzed up Bing Chat and put ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù everywhere.](https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-brings-ai-image-generation-to-copilot-adds-new-model-deucalion/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-1-year-of-sydney)Copilot now rocks a fresh look, AI-driven image magic, and the new kid on the block, Deucalion AI model. They're also dropping a slick ad during the Super Bowl.

**What is going on here?**

Microsoft's Copilot gets better looks, images, and a new model as it comes everywhere.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a6efb7fa-f30f-41df-8509-d4833344bfcb/image.png?t=1707397577)

**What does this mean?**

The facelift for Copilot isn't just the name change. With a cleaner, image-rich interface, it's more user-friendly.

AI image creation and editing are now in the mix, powered by Designer AI (thanks to DALL-E 3 magic). English speakers in the US, UK, Australia, India, and New Zealand get first dibs on AI editing (limited free credits to test it out).

And then there's Deucalion, making Copilot's responses faster and richer, especially in Balanced mode. It's a fine-tuned model, folks from Microsoft said but they didn‚Äôt tell the base model. Likely to be GPT-4 though.

**Why should I care?**

Remembers Sydney? It‚Äôs been a year since Sydney was let loose in Bing Chat. We‚Äôve seen her get locked in an (eternal?) jail and Bing Chat evolve into Copilot.

But Copilot isn‚Äôt your boring champ, it‚Äôs Clippy reincarnated. Please don‚Äôt believe me, find dome tweets of it roasting people and avoiding work.

Just kidding. With the Super Bowl ad, Microsoft‚Äôs message is clear: It wants every common person to use Copilot. And the new fine-tuned model in the balanced model is also rad‚Äîworth testing with ChatGPT (lazyyyy) and seeing how the results compare.

[OpenAI's new project after ChatGPT is crafting AI agents](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-shifts-ai-battleground-to-software-that-operates-devices-automates-tasks?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-1-year-of-sydney)that can literally take the wheel of your digital tasks. Think virtual buddies who are ace at handling your digital errands.

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI is working on AI agents that not just chat but actually get stuff done on your computer and online.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/5bc01b55-6c90-4b80-821d-dbebd8d5e52a/image.png?t=1707398577)

**What does this mean?**

OpenAI is working on two types of agents for now. One type of agent is like a digital puppeteer for your computer, doing all the clicky-typey stuff you'd rather not. Need to shuffle data from a doc to a spreadsheet or sort out pesky expense reports? This agent's got you.

The other type is your go-to web ninja, scouting data, planning trips, or snagging flight deals without you breaking a sweat. But, and it's a big but, these agents need to learn about you to be truly helpful - which means letting them in on your digital secrets, with your say-so, of course.

**Why should I care?**

Because who doesn't want a personal digital whiz? Beyond just cutting down your task list, agents could seriously change most professional work that happens on a screen. And as these agents evolve, they'll get smarter at understanding our needs, making instances like[this](https://twitter.com/andreasklinger/status/1755490423777394888?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-1-year-of-sydney)more common.
