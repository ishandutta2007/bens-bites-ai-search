[The AI-MO Prize is a new $10 million challenge fund](https://aimoprize.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-10m-for-math-geeks)launched by XTX Markets to accelerate the development of AI models that can reason mathematically and solve problems at a level comparable to high-performing humans.

**What is going on here?**

The $10M AIMO fund puts up a challenge to get AI to do math (and get a gold medal).

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d6a52bb0-22a7-4d6e-b1a9-3bbc119c7534/image.png?t=1701172894)

**What does this mean?**

AIMO fund will award progress prizes for models that achieve milestones, plus a $5 million grand prize for the first publicly shared model that wins a gold medal equivalent in an approved AI math competition.

The first approved competitions, with progress presentations at the 2024 International Math Olympiad (IMO), will help compare different AI problem-solving strategies in a way accessible to the general public.

As per Fields medalist and IMO winner Terence Tao, people would be eager to know if AI can match the world‚Äôs brightest young mathematical minds. You bet we would.

**Why should I care?**

Reasoning and planning are two major drawbacks of models like GPTs (autoregressive LLMs). IMO problems require both at a great level to solve them (there‚Äôs an average of 3 hours of time to solve a single question).

The AI-MO Prize connects AI progress to this benchmark of mathematical excellence. IMO gold medalists become leaders in science, engineering and technology, so an AI matching that achievement could profoundly impact these fields.

###### **QUICK BITES**

[Scale AI is collaborating with NVIDIA](https://scale.com/blog/nvidia-steerlm?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-10m-for-math-geeks)to create the next generation of generative AI models using NVIDIA's NeMo SteerLM technique and Scale's high-quality training datasets.

**What is going on here?**

SteerLLM from Nvidia and Scale AI will help developers make apps more aligned towards their outcomes.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c1acd13d-7688-4035-8dd8-585934ac2202/image.png?t=1701172014)

**What does this mean?**

SteerLM comes with an open-source evaluation dataset with 37k samples and different dimensions like helpfulness, correctness, complexity and verbosity.

SteerLM allows developers to dynamically customize model behaviour through easy-to-adjust attributes instead of full retraining. For example, in education applications, SteerLM can tailor model complexity and verbosity to individual learning needs. In gaming, SteerLM enables shaping NPC personality and emotional range.

**Why should I care?**

Making LLMs perform well in industry-specific scenarios is the target for many providers at the moment. Two of the major roadblocks in achieving that are a) access to industry-specific, custom-labelled, high-quality data and b) readymade frameworks with options to crank up/down certain behaviours.

Scale and Nvidia‚Äôs partnership is one solution for both of these. I‚Äôd bet on getting more of such options to come out of LLM fine-tuning/deployment companies in the next months.
