###### **QUICK BITES**

[Mark Zuckerberg announced Meta AI](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/introducing-ai-powered-assistants-characters-and-creative-tools/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-251-mistake-correction), a general purpose assistant at their annual Connect conference yesterday. They have also launched 28 AI characters played by folks like SnoopDogg, Mr. Beast and Kendall Jenner. In addition to the assistant and characters, there are AI stickers and image editing tools.

**What‚Äôs going on here?**

Meta adds AI chatbots and features to its apps‚Äîsome are helpful, some are sassy.

**What does this mean?**

Meta AI is available on WhatsApp, Messenger, and Instagram in the US. It is coming to Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and Quest 3. It is hooked to the internet via Bing from the get-go. Typing /imagine will also let you generate photorealistic images.

The AI characters each have a different personality. For eg: MrBeast is Zach, the big brother who will roast you‚Äîbecause he cares. They will have IG and FB profiles but are not connected to the internet.

AI stickers are added to all Meta apps. With upcoming AI editing tools named Restyle and Backdrop, you can change the styles and backgrounds of your photos. These are made possible by[Meta‚Äôs new image generation model called Emu.](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/emu-enhancing-image-generation-models-using-photogenic-needles-in-a-haystack/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-251-mistake-correction)

**Why should I care?**

Meta has the biggest social distribution in the world and they are meeting their users on these familiar platforms. It‚Äôs similar to what YouTube aimed at with their launch last week. Users won‚Äôt care if the AI sticker has one finger messed up, if the alternative is going to another app and breaking the chat flow with their pal. With this increased adoption, you will now have more AI-generated content in your feeds, if there wasn‚Äôt enough already.

[Cloudflare partners with Hugging Face](https://blog.cloudflare.com/partnering-with-hugging-face-deploying-ai-easier-affordable/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-251-mistake-correction)to make AI models more accessible and affordable.

**What's going on here?**

Cloudflare is launching Workers AI to make AI inference easy and accessible for all developers.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/17dfa08e-1a3f-48fa-873d-9039dc319017/image1-24.png)

**What does this mean?**

Workers AI allows developers to run popular AI models with just a few lines of code, without needing to manage infrastructure. It is powered by Cloudflare's global network of GPUs and provides curated pre-trained models like text generation, translation, image classification and more.

**Why should I care?**

This makes it incredibly simple for any developer to start building with AI, even with zero machine-learning expertise. Now you can deploy an AI-powered app in minutes. For those already using other services, Workers AI is platform-agnostic so you can still access it via API. Cloudflare is also prioritizing developer experience, privacy and global reach. The models are private by default, learning only from your prompts. Cloudflare plans to expand to 100 data centres this year for low latency worldwide. It's currently in open beta so developers can try it out and provide feedback to improve the product before launch.
