The big camera companies Nikon, Sony, and Canon are working on[new tech to add digital signatures to photos.](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Nikon-Sony-and-Canon-fight-AI-fakes-with-new-camera-tech?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-more-ai-in-2024)This will help people spot fake AI-generated images.

**What is going on here?**

Leading camera makers want to find a solid way to tell apart real photos from images edited with AI.

**What does this mean?**

Deepfakes are getting crazy good these days. It's getting really hard to know what's real anymore. To fight this, Nikon, Sony, and Canon are creating built-in features to add tamper-proof digital signatures to photos taken by their new cameras. These signatures will include key details like when and where the photo was taken, and who took it.

These camera brands have teamed up to make a standard for these digital signatures, that can be checked through a free online tool called Verify. If a photo doesn't have credentials, it flags it as potentially fake.

Sony and AP tested a version of this for journalism-related use cases and Sony is planning to bring the tech to its cameras via a firmware update. Nikon and Canon are planning to release new cameras with similar features.

**Why should I care?**

Adobe and Google have extensively talked about embedding watermarks and ‚Äúmade by AI‚Äù credentials in their AI-generated images. The approach by camera makers is different‚Äîadding watermarks to the ‚Äúreal‚Äù photos. Things like this might have implications such as only photos with credentials accepted as proofs in courts.

[Figma is betting its AI tools can improve meetings and collaboration](https://www.fastcompany.com/91002435/figjam-is-betting-its-ai-can-make-meetings-less-terrible-even-without-adobes-backing?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-more-ai-in-2024)despite the failed Adobe acquisition. Figma's new AI features like Jambot and FigJam AI aim to make meetings more engaging and productive.

**What is going on here?**

Figma is adding AI to its ideation tool FigJam.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ce723e18-3ad1-4dc5-b3c0-5b446c1f8cd6/image.png?t=1704192841)

**What does this mean?**

Adobe was to acquire Figma for $20B. Regulators came in, the deal fell off. But in the past few months, Figma has been aggressively pursuing AI to differentiate itself. It acquired an AI startup called Diagram, held internal hackathons and launched various experimental AI features.

These new tools primarily got added to its product called Figjam‚Äîthe ideation and collaboration tool. They can now suggest icebreakers, summarize discussions, and rewrite meeting notes. As per Figma, early user response has been very positive, with people embracing the playful creative elements.

**Why should I care?**

Figma is expanding beyond its core design audience with AI. Two-thirds of its users are now non-designers. The larger selling point now is improved collaboration and ideation, regardless of technical skills. It won‚Äôt be surprising to see startups expand into additional tasks around their main offering.

While the community is constantly hacking on ‚ÄúFigma to code‚Äù stuff, we haven‚Äôt seen much from Figma itself (apart from some plugins).
