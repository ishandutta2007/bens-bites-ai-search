Daily Digest #318

Hello folks, here‚Äôs what we have today;

###### **PICKS**

1. I wrote[a deep dive on Sandwich](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/sandwich-video-uses-ai-business)- a video agency that‚Äôs created commercials for Shopify, Slack, Square, Instacart and Figma. You‚Äôve probably seen their work. I spoke with the Founder, Adam, about how he introduced AI to his team, and how he uses AI in a creative business and personally by leveraging AI characters. He kindly shared chats he‚Äôs had with AI which I found really fascinating.

[Intel is forming a new independent company called Articul8 AI](https://www.reuters.com/technology/intel-spins-out-ai-software-firm-with-backing-digitalbridge-2024-01-03/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-ai-characters-for-business)to commercialize its artificial intelligence software, with financial backing from DigitalBridge Group and other investors.

**What does this mean?**

Articul8 grew out of Intel's work with Boston Consulting Group on AI systems that address customers' privacy, security, and cost concerns about using cloud-based AI services. It will focus on getting enterprise AI systems into production that companies can run safely and in a cost-sustainable way within their own data centres.

Articul8 will have an independent board, with Intel remaining a shareholder. Arun Subramaniyan, former vice president and general manager in Intel‚Äôs data center and AI group will become chief executive of Articul8. This aligns with Intel spinning out other units like Mobileye and its programmable chip division.

**Why should I care?**

The launch of Articul8 signals growing demand for usable enterprise AI amid data privacy concerns. Intel's backing shows its commitment to making AI technology more accessible through new business models. For companies, Articul8 could enable practical AI adoption while maintaining control of data.
