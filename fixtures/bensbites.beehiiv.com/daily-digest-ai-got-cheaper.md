[Learn more from Pinecone Research](https://www.pinecone.io/blog/rag-study/?utm_source=bens-bites\&utm_medium=sponsorship\&utm_campaign=serverless-launch\&utm_content=rag-study)how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) using Pinecone serverless increases relevant answers from GPT-4**by 50%**.

- The larger the search data, the more faithful the results.

- RAG with massive on-demand data outperforms GPT-4 (without RAG), even with the data it was explicitly trained on.

- RAG, with a lot of data, ensures SOTA performance no matter the LLM you choose.

[Fresh from OpenAI](https://openai.com/blog/new-embedding-models-and-api-updates?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-ai-got-cheaper-again): They‚Äôve launched two spanking new embedding models, spiced up GPT-4 Turbo, and made GPT-3.5 Turbo more wallet-friendly. There‚Äôs more on moderation and API usage below.

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI's latest drop is all about giving devs more bang for their buck and some nifty new toys to play with.

**What does this mean?**

The new embedding models: We've got a small one (text-embedding-3-small) that's leaner in price (we're talking a 5X price drop)and a large one (text-embedding-3-large) that‚Äôs the new heavyweight champ.

GPT-3.5 Turbo is about to get cheaper, slashing input costs by 50% and output by 25%. GPT-4 Turbo's new preview model promises to end those frustrating 'lazy' responses (coders unite) and smooth over language hiccups for non-English tasks.

The moderation model got an upgrade, making it tougher on potentially harmful content. We are also getting API key-level metrics in the usage dashboard for better tracking and the ability to assign permissions to API keys.

**Why should I care?**

This update is a toolkit upgrade. And a much-needed one at that. The old embedding models were still the leader but other companies had started to catch up. RAG, and chat with data apps are gonna become cool again.

And, everyone hates lazy chat, so let‚Äôs see how active the updated version is.

[Bret Taylor‚Äôs AI startup is about to become an unicorn.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-26/bret-taylor-s-ai-startup-to-get-funding-at-near-1-billion-value?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-ai-got-cheaper-again)The ex-CEO at Salesforce and an OpenAI board member, is making moves with his AI firm, Sierra.

**What is going on here?**

Sierra is in talks for new funding valuing it at $1B.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e2fb5904-33b3-4d68-9a2e-39ad2ea2f637/image.png?t=1706272109)

**What does this mean?**

Taylor founded this AI startup with Clay Bavor, a former Google hotshot. Now, it is on the brink of hitting unicorn status with a cool nearly $1 billion valuation, thanks to Sequoia Capital leading a hefty $85 million investment round.

Benchmark led an early investment in the company last year and Sierra already has some significant traction. With big names like Taylor and Bavor at the helm and Sequoia Capital opening its wallet, Sierra's one to watch. Taylor has already said that he‚Äôs with OpenAI for a short while‚Äîuntil the board situation sorts out. He‚Äôs got plans.

**Why should I care?**

Taylor‚Äôs got a knack for leading and innovating‚Äîriding Salesforce's ups and Salesforce's downs, and now trying to stabilise OpenAI‚Äôs board. Such people can‚Äôt sit on the sidelines when AI is changing industries. Together with Bavor, Taylor is bringing that magic to Sierra.
