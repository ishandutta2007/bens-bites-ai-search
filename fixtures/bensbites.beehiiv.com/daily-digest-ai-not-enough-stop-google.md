###### **QUICK BITES**

**What's going on here?**

[AI startups and big tech companies are divided](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/battle-opensource-ai)on whether the government should limit access to the most advanced AI models and code.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f5d0192c-542d-4692-804a-fe86ea6188e4/Screenshot_2023-10-03_at_10.51.59.png)

**What does this mean?**

OpenAI and others want regulations so bad actors can't exploit powerful AI, but Meta and startups relying on open-source models oppose restrictions. Advocates argue regulations are needed to prevent misuse, while critics say regulations would stifle innovation and favour big tech firms.

**Why should I care?**

This debate could determine whether developers and startups get access to cutting-edge AI, or if access is concentrated among a few big companies. It also raises important questions around responsible AI development.

The stakes are high in this debate as AI rapidly advances. While most agree less advanced open-source AI should be freely available, views differ on state-of-the-art models trained on far more data. Some like Anthropic oppose open-sourcing them, while Meta supports their release. Microsoft falls in between.

Those supporting stricter oversight say governments should review systems before release to prevent misuse. Startups and investors counter that regulations would limit access and innovation, forcing startups to buy AI from major providers. App developers favour open-source AI to avoid dependency on companies like OpenAI.

It's an important debate with compelling arguments on both sides. The outcome could significantly shape AI's future landscape and who benefits most from its development. As AI grows more powerful, responsible governance balancing innovation and ethical risks will only grow more crucial. This conversation warrants measured consideration by leaders across technology, policy, and business.

[Rewind Pendant](https://www.rewind.ai/pendant?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-ai-is-not-enough-to-stop-google)is a wearable that captures what you say and hear in the real world and then transcribes, encrypts, and stores it entirely locally on your phone.

**What does this mean?**

The Rewind Pendant allows the AI app to learn from a user's real-world conversations and sounds, beyond what they experience on screens. There‚Äôs no demo or launch date but you can pre-order for $59 and secure your spot.

**Why should I care?**

In the past week, we have seen three wearables: Meta-Rayban Smart Glasses, Humane‚Äôs Ai Pin and Avi Schiffman‚Äôs Tab (also in a locket form). Then we have rumours about Open AI building an AI device with the ex-iPhone designer. There are clear signs that the next path for AI integration is physical devices. AI hardware is heating up.

With this heat, there are concerns about privacy and wiretapping laws that these companies still need to address. Someone joked on X: who‚Äôs gonna build a detector for these AI recording devices now?

**What is going on here?**

Despite the hype that generative AI could democratize tech across various regions, the reality is less rosy.[Most AI jobs remain concentrated](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/new-data-shows-that-without-intervention-generative-ai-jobs-will-continue-to-cluster-in-the-same-big-tech-hubs/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-ai-is-not-enough-to-stop-google)in a few key metro areas.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/b770d654-1571-4fbd-a46b-3e01e9704aa6/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

The stats are pretty eye-opening. Over 60% of generative AI jobs posted in the year ending in July 2023 are clustered in just 10 metro areas. More than a fifth of those are in the Bay Area alone. This mirrors earlier findings that over half of the nation‚Äôs AI activity in areas like federal contracting and startups were also focused in a few key regions, such as the Bay Area and 13 "early adopter" metro areas.

**Why should I care?**

If you're gunning for a career in AI or planning a startup, this geographic bottleneck matters. It's not just about Silicon Valley hogging the limelight anymore; it's about real opportunities‚Äîor the lack thereof‚Äîin other places. But it‚Äôs not set in stone. Interventions like federal and state programs could still tilt the scales. Knowing where the jobs are (and aren‚Äôt) helps you strategize, whether you‚Äôre job hunting or policy-making.
