###### **QUICK BITES**

Sam Altman, the big boss at OpenAI, is on a mission to[raise billions for a new chip venture.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/altman-seeks-to-raise-billions-for-network-of-ai-chip-factories?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-ai-poison-and-a-new-unicorn)More deets from Bloomberg that he's betting big on setting up a global network of semiconductor factories.

**What is going on here?**

Sam Altman is back on his plan to create network of factories for semiconductor manufacturing.

**What does this mean?**

Altman's looking ahead, seeing a future where AI's everywhere but chips are scarce. His plan goes one step beyond than the usual tech giant strategy of designing chips and leaving the (hard) work of making them to others.

Altman's wants OpenAI to build its own network of chip factories (fabs). He‚Äôs playing a different game and a long one‚Äîwith the goal to have sufficient chip supply by the end of the decade.

He's talking with G42 and SoftBank to raise money. Bloomberg reports that Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, knows about this plan and is interested in it.

**Why should I care?**

Building a network of state-of-the-art fabs is expensive and time-consuming. Previous reports mention talks of raising up to $10 billion with G42. It's a bold move, especially since companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft prefer to outsource manufacturing. If Altman's right, and there's a chip crunch as AI booms, we know which company is gonna be ahead of the game.

###### **QUICK BITES**

You've probably heard about ElevenLabs, that cool AI voice tech company.[They just bagged $80 million in Series B funding](https://elevenlabs.io/blog/series-b/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-ai-poison-and-a-new-unicorn), pushing their total funds to a neat $101 million. And guess what? They're now valued at over a billion dollars!

**What is going on here?**

ElevenLabs is on a roll with funding and new products in the pipeline.

**What does this mean?**

The cash influx is led by big names like Andreessen Horowitz and others. Started in 2022 by a couple of tech-savvy guys, Piotr Dabkowski and Mati Staniszewski, Elevan Labs is one of the leading AI voice companies now. From a modest team of 5, they've scaled up to 40 and are eyeing about 100 by year's end.

They will be rolling out some fancy new tools like a Dubbing Studio for movie buffs, a Voice Library Marketplace for voice creators to earn some dough, and a Mobile Reader App that turns text and URLs into audio in the upcoming weeks.

**Why should I care?**

Voice Cloning is a big market and ElevenLabs is a name to watch. Movies, audiobooks, or just browsing the web, their tech could change how you experience media. Plus, if you're in the tech biz or a voice artist, this could open up some exciting opportunities.
