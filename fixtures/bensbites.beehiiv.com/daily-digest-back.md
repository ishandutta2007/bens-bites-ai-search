The drama at OpenAI seems to have come to a halt for now. Sam is returning as CEO. The OAI team got back to shipping even before the news broke.[ChatGPT with voice](https://twitter.com/openai/status/1727065166188274145?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-we-re-so-back)is now available to all free users.

**Nice. I want details‚Ä¶**

The OpenAI X account posted that they have reached an[agreement in principle](https://twitter.com/openai/status/1727205556136579362?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-we-re-so-back). Sam will return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo.

Taylor is ex-CEO of Salesforce and one of the most senior/sought-after folks on tech company boards. Summers is the former US Secretary of the Treasury.

[Bloomberg reported](https://twitter.com/emilychangtv/status/1727216818648134101?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-we-re-so-back)that the final discussions on who‚Äôll be on the board were sticky. OpenAI's initial board will also vet and appoint a new formal board of up to 9 people. Microsoft and Sam Altman will likely have a seat on that formal board. ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23967223/sam-altman-returns-ceo-open-ai?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-we-re-so-back))

**And the rest of the people?**

Emmett is now the Interim ex-CEO of Open AI as per his X bio. He‚Äôs glad to have played a part in the solution.

Though Helen Toner (one of the*coup\**members) posted ‚ÄúAnd now, we all get some sleep‚Äù retweeting the OpenAI announcement, the[NYT reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/openai-altman-board-fight.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-we-re-so-back)that a paper co-written by her in October was a major part of the disagreements.

**There‚Äôs still one big question: why did all this happen?**

The new board will investigate this internally, to which[Sam has agreed](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/breaking-sam-altman-to-return-as-openai-ceo?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-we-re-so-back). A few hours before the ‚ÄúAll is well‚Äù news came, a bunch of former employees of OpenAI shared a letter to the board to[expand the scope of the investigation](https://twitter.com/pitdesi/status/1727106366534492562?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-we-re-so-back)with their allegation of Sam‚Äôs (and the exec team‚Äôs) actions during the 2019 transition from non-profit to for-profit.

So, if you‚Äôre drama-hungry, there‚Äôs more to happen. And if you‚Äôre a late bloomer and don‚Äôt know what happened, check out our two pieces covering:üçø[the weekend AI stopped](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/open-ai-fires-sam-altman-weekend-drama-summarized)andüçø[the updates leading up to the return of OpenAI.](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/whats-going-open-ai)

[Anthropic has released Claude 2.1](https://www.anthropic.com/index/claude-2-1?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-we-re-so-back), the latest version of its AI assistant, with several major upgrades including a 200,000 token context window, reduced rates of hallucination, and new tool use capabilities. So with the new chad in town, will you break up with OpenAI?

**What is going on here?**

Anthropic has launched Claude 2.1, with a set of improvements over Claude 2.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/321646f8-2a90-454c-8a6d-e32d6dd01e45/image.png?t=1700650835)

**What does this mean?**

200,000 tokens are equivalent to 500 pages of text, so you can fit all the messages you send to your ex. It‚Äôs also improving in using that big context window‚Äî2x fewer instances of hallucinating information. Anthropic calls this gains in honesty. Feels like your ex saying, ‚Äú*Yes, baby, let‚Äôs get back together. I‚Äôve made significant gains in honesty.‚Äù*

Claude 2.1 is also more accurate and reliable in its outputs‚Äîa 30% drop in incorrect answers and 3-4x lower rates of unsupported claims. In simple words, Claude will lie less and try not to gaslight you.

With API access, you can now also access extra tools via API, but the feature is in beta. Some more features in the developer console to top it all off: System prompts and a playground for testing prompts.

**Why should I care?**

For enterprise users of Claude's API, version 2.1 brings the assistant to new levels of functionality with full documents. New tool integrations allow Claude to directly query databases, make API calls and more based on natural language requests.

Claude 2.1 is live on the free and pro plans but the increased context length is reserved for pro users.
