###### **QUICK BITES**

Sam Altman is officially back as OpenAI‚Äôs CEO. The rest of the team is also back to building beyond the 1st year of ChatGPT. Yup, this little bad boy came out in the world a year ago. Feels like ages ago.

**What‚Äôs going on here?**

Sam Altman is back as Open AI‚Äôs CEO and has a message for everyone.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/71f691c4-8086-4758-8d3a-0a7fe11b04e1/image.png?t=1701340052)

**What does this mean?**

Sam‚Äôs written a touchy-feely letter for his team. Bret‚Äôs version (Chair of the new board) is more straight to the point. Though, the wording in both letters is carefully chosen.

The highlights you need to know:

- Mira Murati (CTO) and Greg Brockman (Director) are also back with 3 researchers who left the same night. Ilya‚Äôs (Chief Scientist, ex?) work at OpenAI is under discussion. He‚Äôs not making it back to the board.

- Microsoft is getting a non-voting observer seat on the board. The cleanest option for Satya without regulator trouble. Enough mentions of the word ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù while talking about selecting new board members.

- Greg and Sam are partners in running the company. Soon, the org chart will reflect that. The governance structure of the company will also improve.

- No single employee or customer has left Open AI.

**Why should I care?**

The Verge has an interview with Sam with straight and no-sugar-coated questions. It‚Äôs practical and emotional at the same time. In the interview, Sam confirms the Q \* leak and says there‚Äôs rapid progress in general. Hold on folks, OpenAI ain‚Äôt done yet.

[Perplexity has launched two new AI models](https://blog.perplexity.ai/blog/introducing-pplx-online-llms?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-it-s-birthday-season)- pplx-7b-online and pplx-70b-online. These publicly available models will provide helpful, accurate and up-to-date responses, addressing key limitations around freshness and hallucinations.

**What is going on here?**

Perplexity‚Äôs new models access timely information from the internet to give useful, factual responses - things offline models struggle with.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1160c56a-a5f1-4325-aaf5-b804fb6c6139/image.png?t=1701341926)

**What does this mean?**

The models build on existing open-source models like Mistral-7B and Llama-70B base models. Then these models are layered (fine-tuning) with current web information to answer questions needing recent data better than offline models. The goal fo these models is to give helpful, non-hallucinated responses.

Perplexity evaluated the models for freshness, accuracy and usefulness and they think the models are well-suited for real-world uses like answering consumer questions where up-to-date info is key. As part of the launch, Perplexity has opened up access to the models through its public API and Perplexity Labs playground.

**Why should I care?**

Consumer products like ChatGPT are adding search to the products. Search results reduce hallucination and people care about real-time info.

But figuring out the search when building with most models is tiresome. PPLX‚Äôs new online models API come with their SEO expertise built in for you. No need for that extra search API.
