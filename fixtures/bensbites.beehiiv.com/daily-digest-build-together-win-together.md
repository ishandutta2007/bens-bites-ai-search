There‚Äôs a[new collaboration group on AI safety and progress.](https://newsroom.ibm.com/AI-Alliance-Launches-as-an-International-Community-of-Leading-Technology-Developers,-Researchers,-and-Adopters-Collaborating-Together-to-Advance-Open,-Safe,-Responsible-AI?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-build-together-win-together)The[AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-build-together-win-together)from IBM and Meta is bringing together leading developers, researchers, academics, companies and innovators to collaborate on projects supporting trustworthy and inclusive AI systems.

**What is going on here?**

IBM and Meta have launched an international AI Alliance along with over 50 other organizations to advance open and responsible AI innovation.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/474697be-5899-4a66-ac13-f9edfddca184/image.png?t=1701868233)

**What does this mean?**

There are 50 initial members with universities, organizations and companies. Apart from AI companies like Hugging Face and Stability AI, the Alliance also includes Dell, Sony and CERN.

By pooling knowledge and resources, Alliance members will try to create benchmarks and tools for safe and ethical AI development. So that rather than addressing risks later, members can proactively tackle challenges around bias, security and more. The Alliance believes it‚Äôll allow faster innovation of AI systems that work with the complexity of global societies.

**Why should I care?**

Most of the institutions and companies in this Alliance are pro-open source. The Alliance will set up guidelines, a board and a technical oversight committee for different areas of progress.

To be critical, it feels like these sorts of groups are coming up every month now. But with a million plus staff members, 400k+ students and $80B+ in R\&D funds, the AI alliance seems like a group that wants progress, has enough skin in the game and has the power to build. Let‚Äôs see how this one works.

Just like ChatGPT,[Microsoft‚Äôs Copilot has also completed its year one](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/12/05/celebrating-the-first-year-of-copilot-with-significant-new-innovations/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-build-together-win-together)and Microsoft‚Äôs celebrating. And it is promising some of the other AI features coming into Copilot‚Äîsome old and some new.

**What is going on here?**

Microsoft Copilot is going to get some ‚Äúnew‚Äù AI features in its second year.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ae69c650-0720-49f9-9e1d-c3be6250511a/image.png?t=1701866893)

**What does this mean?**

To start with, Copliot will also be using the new model from OpenAI‚ÄîGPT-4 Turbo and an updated version of DALL-E3. Then Code interpreter will slowly to Copilot (fka Bing chat)‚Äîat first just using code to answer queries and then with the ability to add your own files, just like ChatGPT plus. Similarly, Microsoft is combining GPT-4V with its web image and search data to make Copilot multimodal.

There are two ‚Äúnew‚Äù product-specific features as well (not taken from ChatGPT) ‚ÄîInline Compose and Deep Search. Inline compose can get Copilot to rewrite text on any website (unclear what this means) and Deep Search can refine queries with extra information and specific requests (like in Perplexity).

**Why should I care?**

If I‚Äôm being honest, GPT-4 Turbo is not the most impressive addition when everyone is complaining that it‚Äôs worse. But what makes me (and[Ethan](https://x.com/emollick/status/1732096645678895476?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-build-together-win-together)) excited is that soon many capabilities of ChatGPT Plus will be free in 169 countries. Especially when ChatGPT plus subscriptions are paused.

Another interesting point is that Copilot is evolving beyond the chatbox and adding more product-specific features in Edge and Search. These, IMO, have the power to take users away from Google products.
