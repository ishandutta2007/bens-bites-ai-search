1. I wrote about the trend of AI coding‚Ä¶[**‚ÄùAI coding is exploding‚Äù.**](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/ai-coding-exploding)I can‚Äôt code but I think there are a bunch of new opportunities in this new era of code + AI that are emerging. I highlight some key players, some real reviews I collected and, as always, some places you could build something in this space.

2.

###### **QUICK BITES**

[Nvidia will collaborate with Japanese companies](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2023/12/04/nvidia-japan-ai-processors-priority/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-china-and-japan), research institutions, and startups to create "factories of AI" and invest in developing homegrown AI talent and infrastructure.

**What is going on here?**

Nvidia CEO says he will try to prioritize Japan for AI processors.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7cc3b96a-ae3f-4fdd-9384-6b2df715ce13/image.png?t=1701768969)

**What does this mean?**

Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang stated Japan has no need to export its data or AI, implying it has the technical expertise and industrial capability to nurture a self-sufficient AI ecosystem. Huang also met with the Japanese Prime Minister and said that he has promised the PM to prioritise Japan‚Äôs request for GPUs.

**Why should I care?**

We are going to see this more: countries wanting to get AI companies to work with them (especially the hardware makers). And at the same time, companies going outside just the US/EU to find more flexible business terms (like China-related regulations).

[The Beijing Internet Court said an AI-generated picture qualified as original artwork](https://www.scmp.com/tech/tech-trends/article/3243570/beijing-courts-ruling-ai-generated-content-can-be-covered-copyright-eschews-us-stand-far-reaching?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-china-and-japan)for copyright protection thanks to the human creator's input in designing it. To compare, the US rulings have been implying that AI creations cannot be copyrighted.

**What is going on here?**

The Chinese court ruled that AI-generated images are subject to copyright law.

**What does this mean?**

A blogger shared an AI image created by someone else and got sued. The Court decided that the AI image creator has the copyright for the image because there was an intellectual investment in writing prompts, specifying parameters and processes to match aesthetic choice.

The blogger is fined 500-Yuan (about $70), though the decision can be appealed. Also, the court says that AI copyright should be discussed case-by-case.

**Why should I care?**

A US court disallowed giving users copyright to AI-generated material earlier this year. While many people are focused on the backwards-looking debate of the copyright drama: ‚ÄúHey, they used my data to train‚Äù, I think the more important question is forward-looking: to understand who gets credit for the new images.

India earlier said that AI is not a person, so it can not get copyright but users might based on differences in cases. This decision from China seems similar. There‚Äôs certainly a difference in how different countries are looking at AI.
