###### **QUICK BITES**

[OpenAI and Apple are negotiating content licensing deals](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-offers-publishers-as-little-as-1-million-a-year?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-deal-or-no-deal)with news publishers to train their AI systems. But according to sources the deal sizes are smaller than the industry expects. Some publishers feel they aren't getting fair value.

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI deal size for access to publishers‚Äô content is smaller than expected.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d920bb16-0ac2-41f3-9879-c908af394a84/image.png?t=1704451297)

**What does this mean?**

We‚Äôre talking about offers as low as $1-5 million annually to some publishers. It‚Äôs like getting the assistant a coffee to peek inside the boss‚Äôs laptop. Apple is saying the ‚Äúdinner‚Äôs on me‚Äù but wants to copy stuff to its hard drive. Basically more flexibility in how it uses the content. Google feels behind in the race (again) but let‚Äôs not forget that Google already has TeamViewer access with its products like Google News.

Although OpenAI has made some big-name deals earlier (Alex Springer and Associated Press), more publishers will want to hold out and see how the NYT‚Äôs case against OpenAI turns out.

**Why should I care?**

OpenAI (and other AI companies) will push harder to secure these contracts with publishers to a) get their hands on unique data and b) signal their ‚Äúfriendship‚Äù with creators. At the same time, it‚Äôs likely that more publisher will sue AI companies over the use of their materials.

I wonder if there‚Äôs an opportunity for smaller media houses here to go with the AI companies, instead of against them.

###### **QUICK BITES**

Google is preparing to launch a paid upgrade to its AI chatbot Bard, called Bard Advanced. Google announced Bard Advanced with its Gemini models in December, saying it‚Äôll be launched early this year. Seems like they truly meant early because the production[code hidden within the Bard website](https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1742939270644748747?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-deal-or-no-deal)highlights many upcoming features.

**What is going on here?**

Google‚Äôs about to release Bard‚Äôs paid version with new features.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/3caafcc1-3c24-44d2-bac7-1bb957fea398/image.png?t=1704455237)

**What does this mean?**

It‚Äôs likely Bard Advanced will be bundled with Google's storage subscription service Google One, though there‚Äôs not much detail on which tiers will have Bard Advanced. Bard Advanced will use Google‚Äôs best model yet, Gemini Ultra, which[‚Äúseemingly‚Äù beat GPT-4.](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/googles-gemini-beats-gpt4-cost)

With Bard Advanced there are a bunch of new features that might come:

\*\*1) GPT-like bots.\*\*These are codenamed Mokoto in the leaks and code[screenshots](https://twitter.com/bedros_p/status/1742626910088126566?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-deal-or-no-deal)have URL structure as ‚Äú/bots/create‚Äù. These might be custom chatbots like OpenAI‚Äôs GPTs.

\*\*2) Prompt improvements.\*\*A feature called Power Up would expand your simple prompts into advanced, better prompts.

In addition, there‚Äôs an**inspiration gallery**(suggesting prompts and ways to use AI have been a go-to move by Google and Bard) and\*\*background images for shared chats.\*\*Pure aesthetics and I‚Äôm here for it.

Other features like Tasks and Sparkle are also in the Twitter chatter but there‚Äôs not much info on them yet.
