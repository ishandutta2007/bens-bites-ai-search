###### **QUICK BITES**

[Bard's got some cool updates.](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-gemini-pro-image-generation/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-draw-me-a-bard)It now offers Gemini Pro in more countries and can check its answers better, but the biggest of all is image generation. Yup, you can now create images in Bard.

**What is going on here?**

Bard's now global with Gemini Pro and can whip up images.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/abf8b39d-e174-42f1-8f58-c14e56188e66/image.png?t=1706876044)

**What does this mean?**

So, Gemini Pro, Google‚Äôs language model equivalent to GPT 3.5 is now in Bard for over 40 languages and 230+ countries. Similarly, Bard has a double-check feature that checks generated answers against web content to flag incorrect responses. It also works better and in more countries & languages now.

And if that's not enough, Bard's now your personal artist, creating images from your prompts, thanks to the Imagen 2 model. And, Google‚Äôs all about embedding digital watermarks in these images, using their tool called Synth ID. (how reliable is that is a topic for another time)

**Why should I care?**

Recently Bard with Gemini Pro climbed the charts in a community-driven leaderboard, getting to number 2 just behind GPT-4 Turbo by OpenAI. So users are getting that performance in more languages.

Also, this isn‚Äôt Bard Advanced, the version powered by Google‚Äôs Gemini Ultra, which it claims beats GPT-4, so we‚Äôll have to see what kind of fight that one brings.

Images are definitely not the best of what‚Äôs out there, but it‚Äôs free, and in some quick checks I found it more visually appealing than some stuff I got from DallE. So, worth keeping an eye on.

[Amazon's beta testing out Rufus](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-rufus?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-draw-me-a-bard), an AI assistant designed to make shopping on its app smooth. It's like having a personal shopping buddy in your pocket, trained on Amazon's vast product universe and a sprinkle of web wisdom.

**What is going on here?**

Amazon is about to launch an ecommerce chatbot called Rufus.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c66728ff-b0df-4ab8-8844-0283806f7af2/image.png?t=1706878253)

**What does this mean?**

Rufus is here to change how we shop on Amazon, making it more interactive and intuitive. The most important of these is answering questions based on a specific product. Rufus will generate answers based on listing details, customer reviews, and community Q\&As to tell you if a product meets your requirements.

Just like any other chatbot, Rufus is also designed to help with:

- \*\*Pre-purchase information:\*\*It‚Äôll answer questions like, ‚Äúwhat to consider when buying headphones?‚Äù

- \*\*Use case based purchases:\*\*Want to plan an event? Ask Rufus what you need to buy.

- \*\*Compare product categories:\*\*Go deep in the weeds to figure out the difference between trail vs. road running shoes.

- \*\*Gifting ideas:\*\*How can we forget the classic LLM chatbot example‚Äî‚ÄúWhat do I get her for Valentine‚Äôs day‚Äù, right?

But Rufus is not just another chatbot; it's a shopping specialist. It‚Äôs built on unique data from retail stores, it digs into customer reviews, Q\&As, and the web to find exactly what you need. Rufus would support voice or chat interactions, i.e. type away or talk; Rufus listens.

**Why should I care?**

I‚Äôm bullish on large companies using LLMs to solve tiny use cases (alongside going for big bets). I like the recent upgrade in Amazon reviews where comments are grouped according to the sentiment. It does get some things wrong, but navigating a few categories instead of individual comments makes it easier.

I bet it‚Äôll take some time for Rufus to make its way to everyone, as this is just a beta launch in the US but I‚Äôm excited to see if it can help in making shopping any better.
