###### **QUICK BITES**

Figma has expanded the[AI integration into its visual collaboration tool FigJam](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-ai-to-figjam/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-who-else-got-access)to make it more useful and accessible. It can now help users generate templates, diagrams, and summaries, allowing anyone to create visuals from simple text prompts.

**What is going on here?**

Figma added AI features to its visual collaboration product FigJam.

**What does this mean?**

The new AI capabilities in FigJam aim to solve two key problems: the "blank canvas" issue where users struggle to start a new file, and making visual collaboration tools more accessible to non-designers. By allowing users to describe their needs in plain language, FigJam can now instantly generate customized templates for weekly meetings, brainstorms, timelines etc.

Second, is the grunt work after brainstorming: it can sort stickies into groups automatically and summarize the discussions to get clarity on the key takeaways and next steps.

**Why should I care?**

Combining both you can go from a blank canvas to a personalized FigJam file while keeping your focus and time dedicated to the ideas being discussed, not manual tasks. The AI does the heavy lifting.

For new users, it‚Äôll get them started faster and more experienced users can do more with these features.

At OpenAI‚Äôs first DevDay conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made a surprise appearance during Sam Altman‚Äôs keynote. While Sam kept poking him, Satya was calm in repeating the fact that they are building the infrastructure that OpenAI needs. To which Sam replied: we have the[best partnership in tech.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2023/11/07/come-build-with-us-microsoft-and-openai-partnership-unveils-new-ai-opportunities/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-who-else-got-access)

**What is going on here?**

Microsoft is again leveraging Open AI‚Äôs new announcements and plans to announce more features based off them.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1d960f93-cd9f-47e3-ac4b-422212dbcd71/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

The new GPT-4 Turbo offers lower pricing, longer prompts, and JSON formatting for improved efficiency. These Turbo models will be available on Azure OpenAI Service by the end of 2023. On Azure, pricing will match OpenAI's prices.

The new custom chatbots, GPTs will allow anyone to create tailored ChatGPT versions for specific tasks or audiences. Microsoft is planning a deep ecosystem support for GPTs that they‚Äôll announce soon.

Microsoft will provide seamless integration of OpenAI and support infrastructure, meeting all enterprise needs for the new custom models program. Microsoft also gave DevDay attendees free 90-day GitHub Enterprise access.

**Why should I care?**

They might seem like they are competing for enterprise attention, but both of them respect their mutual dependency to keep marching ahead in the race of AI. (even though Google is nowhere to be seen).

[Xbox and an AI startup Inworld are joining forces](https://inworld.ai/blog/xbox-partners-with-inworld-ai-to-build-generative-ai-tools-for-game-development?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-who-else-got-access)to whip up some clever AI tools for game makers. This multi-year partnership will mix Inworld's expertise in AI character creation with Microsoft's cloud AI services to bake accessible AI tools for all game creators.

**What is going on here?**

Xbox and Inworld will work together to build AI tools to help game developers cook up better stories and characters.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/682b0a39-3e6e-490a-9235-8b83a52a9dee/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

The main tools they plan to build are an AI design copilot to turn ideas into detailed game scripts, and a character engine to generate dynamic in-game narratives.

The AI copilot aims to loosen things up so developers can imagine more expansive game worlds and stories. As a helping hand, it will transform high-level creative ideas into detailed dialogue trees, quests, and scripts. Inworld is chatting with narrative designers to shape what the tool can do.

The character engine will conduct multiple AI models to enable characters that dynamically respond to player actions and choices in real time. This brings life to characters in ways not possible before. The focus is expanding what the engine can do and optimizing performance.

**Why should I care?**

Immersive storytelling and character involvement in games will likely increase if all goes well. The AI copilot will save developers time, enabling richer game worlds. The character engine will transform gameplay with responsive NPCs.

Dynamic narratives and NPCs have been top requests from gamers. With 99% saying advanced AI will improve games, this partnership responds directly to what players want - more agency through adaptable worlds and characters.
