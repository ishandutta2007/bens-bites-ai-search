###### **QUICK BITES**

A new Beatles song called["Now And Then"](https://youtu.be/AW55J2zE3N4?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-and-everyone-said-kumbaya)is being released 45 years after John Lennon started writing it. The full Fab Four are featured[thanks to artificial intelligence technology.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/02/a-new-beatles-song-is-set-for-release-after-45-years-with-help-from-ai.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-and-everyone-said-kumbaya)

**What is going on here?**

The "last Beatles song" debuts Thursday on streaming platforms after AI cleaned up and isolated Lennon's original vocals from a 1978 demo tape.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/914b25a8-c9c7-4867-8180-577e84602347/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

Lennon recorded himself singing and playing piano for the song in New York two years before he died. The other Beatles tried completing the track in 1995 but struggled with the poor sound quality of Lennon's tape.

Director Peter Jackson revived the project recently while making the Beatles documentary "Get Back." He used AI to remove background noise and improve Lennon's vocal audio so it could be properly mixed with new instrumentation. Paul McCartney said this technology let them get John's voice "pure" and finish the song like normal.

George Harrison, who died in 2001, will be heard in some guitar sections from the 1995 sessions.

**Why should I care?**

This is an exciting chance to hear the Fab Four together in a "new" song decades after their breakup and deaths. The use of AI opens possibilities for reviving more old recordings or even creating new music posthumously.

But it also poses ethical questions around consent and manipulating the art of dead artists. As a Beatles fan, you may be thrilled to get one last song but conflicted on how it was created. This release foreshadows issues that will arise as AI generates new content mimicking real people, including the dead.

###### **QUICK BITES**

The privacy-focused web browser[Brave has launched Leo, a new AI chatbot](https://brave.com/leo-release/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-and-everyone-said-kumbaya)integrated directly into the browser. The Leo chatbot competes with Bing's new ChatGPT integration and Google's Bard AI.

**What is going on here?**

Brave is offering an AI chatbot Leo, that aligns with its commitment to user privacy.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/710c7040-87cb-43d3-a9f7-35f25dc10b45/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

Leo provides standard AI chatbot features like answering questions and summarizing webpages. However, conversations with Leo are not recorded or used to train AI models. Users also don't need to create an account to use Leo. This contrasts with Bing Chat and Google Bard which connect conversations and search histories to user accounts.

The base Leo chatbot uses Meta's Llama 2 AI model and is free for all Brave desktop users. An upgraded Leo Premium subscription offers faster response times and the ability to choose Anthropic's Claude AI model instead. Additional premium features include priority access during peak times, higher rate limits, and early access to new capabilities.

**Why should I care?**

Brave is promising an AI assistant that doesn't compromise user privacy, unlike the tech giants' offerings. With Leo, you can access AI chatbot features without sharing personal data or linking conversations to your identity.

More browsers are adding AI assistants to their native experience. Opera has already done it a while back, now Brave is joining in with Leo. Although Bard exists, Chrome still doesn‚Äôt have a native AI chatbot.
