[OpenAI discusses its ‚Äúlove‚Äù for Journalism.](https://openai.com/blog/openai-and-journalism?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-gen-ai-in-our-daily-life)The latest post from the AI company presents their position on training AI models on copyrighted content like news articles in response to a recent lawsuit from The New York Times.

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI believes training models on copyrighted content is fair use but provides their POV on the NYT lawsuit.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/177dc825-faa9-4e29-bc05-7b6b8f972152/image.png?t=1704801487)

**What does this mean?**

OpenAI gives out 4 points to make their case:

- \*\*Collaboration with news organizations:\*\*OpenAI has recently partnered with AP, Alex Springer, American Journalism Project and NYU. In return, they are helping reporters and editors with time-consuming tasks.

- \*\*Training is fair use.\*\*OpenAI stands strong on this claim by linking to support comments and ruling in other countries.

- \*\*‚ÄúRegurgitation‚Äù is a rare bug.\*\*Exact memorization happens when the same content is in the dataset multiple times. OpenAI is working to solve this, and claims NYT‚Äôs small footprint in the training material doesn‚Äôt matter.

- \*\*NYT is acting in bad faith.\*\*OpenAI and NYT were in talks before the court case and it claims that NYT didn‚Äôt inform OpenAI about this move. OpenAI makes itsdefenseattack, stating that the examples shown by New York Times are cherry-picked, created by manipulated prompts with excerpts of those articles, and not an ‚Äúallowed‚Äù use according to OpenAI‚Äôs terms anyway.

**Why should I care?**

Throughout, OpenAI pats its back with examples of their actions like linking to fetched articles, providing opt-out options, and removing the browsing feature in July.

Brilliant PR move from Open AI. The statement positions OpenAI as a ‚Äúfriend of journalists and NYT‚Äôs move as bad faith, anti-technology move. Will OpenAi be able to do so in court though?

[Volkswagen will use ChatGPT](https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/8/24027112/volkswagen-chatgpt-openai-voice-assistant-cars-ces?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-gen-ai-in-our-daily-life)to enhance its existing IDA in-car voice assistant, enabling more natural conversations between driver and car. The AI chatbot will be able to control vehicle functions, answer questions, and have more intuitive interactions.

**What is going on here?**

Volkswagen‚Äôs gonna start putting ChatGPT in its cars starting middle of 2024.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/087f31ae-0bb9-40dd-83a1-1680d43bce7d/image.png?t=1704797978)

**What does this mean?**

VW wants to upgrade its current voice assistant, IDA. Right now IDA's pretty limited, but with ChatGPT it can have more natural conversations with drivers. So you could ask it stuff about your car or get directions just by talking to it casually. VW says it'll delete any data from the chats immediately too.

Still, ChatGPT sometimes makes stuff up when it doesn't know the real answer. So don't fully trust what it tells you! VW's working with a company called Cerence to try and make a solid car version.

**Why should I care?**

VW's the first company to officially say it's putting ChatGPT in cars. That's cool they're leading the pack. But I wonder if the AI will get confused about different car models and stuff like that.

Remember that Chevy dealer that used ChatGPT as a virtual assistant? People totally trolled it by asking to buy cars for $1 and writing Python for them. These AIs can go off the rails if you try to trick 'em.

But old-school car voice assistants are pretty stale and many other automakers are announcing their tests with generative AI. So, AI like ChatGPT will probably take over soon. VW's just getting a head start.
