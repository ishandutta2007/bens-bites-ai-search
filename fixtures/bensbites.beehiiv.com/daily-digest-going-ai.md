[Google Maps is the next app getting generative AI upgrades](https://blog.google/products/maps/google-maps-generative-ai-local-guides/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-going-out-with-ai)(after Chrome, YouTube and Workspace). The goal is to make it a powerhouse for discovering new spots. Whether you want a day out with friends with all sorts of preferences or just looking for something unique, Maps wants to help with all types of queries.

**What is going on here?**

Google's rolling out AI magic in Maps to suggest places based on your vibe or needs, starting with a select group of Local Guides in the U.S.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1cf5b142-f81b-4d52-be1f-dbaae9943c14/image.png?t=1707126052)

**What does this mean?**

Imagine you're craving some vintage shopping in San Francisco. Ideally, you want to hop around different types of shops: clothes, jewellery and trinkets, or maybe electronics. The basic Maps search doesn‚Äôt do a good job at that.

With generative AI over ratings, reviews, and photos from Maps‚Äô community, Google‚Äôs trying to serve up some top-notch recommendations. You get the results similar to a normal Maps query but you can now also create a thread by asking follow-up questions.

**Why should I care?**

I‚Äôve tried to use Bard for similar use cases. Bard‚Äôs much better than ChatGPT at this but still I‚Äôve had two troubles: a) it‚Äôs limited in options and stops after 3-4 recommendations and b) it‚Äôs detached from the navigation functions of Maps (though it‚Äôs been improving on it). With Gen AI inside Maps and follow-up questions, I can see it being a regular use case for many people.

It‚Äôs first coming to Local Guides in the US, but the recent speed of Google‚Äôs product integrations is somewhat refreshing‚ÄîI‚Äôm not holding this one against them.

[There‚Äôs a shift in AI hiring](https://www.signalfire.com/blog/ai-vy-league?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-going-out-with-ai)‚Äîfrom Ivy League degrees to real-world experience at top AI startups. Top AI talent is now found in startups like OpenAI, Cohere etc., not just Harvard, Stanford PhDs or ex-Googlers.

**What is going on here?**

SignalFire's data shows a new source of AI talent emerging, dubbed AI-vy league.

**What does this mean?**

The report says that since 2015 there‚Äôs been a drop in the importance of traditional degrees for AI roles. The same trend follows for people who went to top schools like Ivy-leagues or big tech companies like Meta or Google.

But then what type of talent is being hired, and where do they come from? Turns out the focus is on practical AI skills and achievements, not just academic credentials. And this top talent is concentrated in the ‚ÄúAI-vy League" i.e. 9 AI startups. These are:

Open AI, Anthropic, Inflection AI, Mosaic ML (acquired by DataBricks), Cohere and AI21 laps, Stability AI, Midjourney, and Hugging Face. (in no order)

Though the de-credentialization is in part due to necessity‚Äîthe tech world needs so much AI talent that demand may outstrip supply from top universities.

**Why should I care?**

Big tech companies are now targeting these startups for recruitment, indicating a shift in what's valued in AI talent. This trend democratizes the field, making it more about ability and less about educational background. Useful signals if you‚Äôre hiring or want a job in the AI space.
