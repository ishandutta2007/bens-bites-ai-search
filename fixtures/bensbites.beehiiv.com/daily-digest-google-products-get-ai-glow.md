[Guess what‚Äôs latest on Chrome? Easy, it‚Äôs AI.](https://blog.google/products/chrome/google-chrome-generative-ai-features-january-2024/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-products-get-ai-glow-up)With the new Chrome release (M121), Google‚Äôs stepping up its game with some fresh AI-powered features.

**What is going on here?**

Chrome's getting pumped with new AI features.

**What does this mean?**

Chrome's rolling out three AI features.

- \*\*First, there's the Tab Organizer:\*\*Forget the hassle of sorting tabs; Chrome‚Äôs got you sorted with automatic smart groupings and even suggests names and emojis for easy identification. Tab organizer uses the page titles and URLs of open tabs in the active window to do this.

- \*\*Next, AI-generated themes:\*\*Create your own vibe with generative AI wallpapers. Choose your mood, style, color, and subject, and voila ‚Äì a personalized theme just for you. There‚Äôs no prompting, so the customization is still limited.

- \*\*Help me write:\*\*The third feature is not there yet in Chrome. But we‚Äôve seen this one. Right-click and select ‚Äúhelp me write‚Äù to use AI to write. Just that it‚Äôll work on every text-box on Chrome.

**Why should I care?**

Big disclaimer: these are experimental features in US only. Google says it‚Äôll come to everyone soon but just FYI. Let‚Äôs be honest, themes are meh. Help me write could be useful but depends on the model behind it (likely to be Gemini Pro‚Äîequivalent to GPT-3.5). The tab grouping feature stands out the most for me, and I hope it is as good as in the[demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/MP4_Tab_Organizer_Chrome.mp4?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-products-get-ai-glow-up).

**What is going on here?**

Microsoft is focusing on small language models (SLMs) to cut down costs and computing power.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/f8223192-267b-4812-a73f-0149da4a7c5c/image.png?t=1706092502)

**What does this mean?**

Microsoft has been big on AI, especially with their heavy investment in OpenAI. But we all know, GPT-4‚Äôs too power-hungry. So now, Microsoft is creating this new team to make AI more economical. They've pulled in their top AI brains from research teams into a GenAI team to develop these SLMs, including leading researcher S√©bastien Bubeck.

The GenAI team is different from Microsoft‚Äôs Turing team which focuses on making larger models. GenAI is led by Corporate Vice President Misha Bilenko and answers to Kevin Scott, the CTO.

**Why should I care?**

These SLMs are nifty because, with some optimizations and a narrow application range, they can do much of what the larger models do but on a diet of less computing juice. Microsoft‚Äôs Phi models, its attempt at SLMs, has gained much attention among companies and fine-tuning hackers. The Phi series of models is already being tested by Goldman Sachs. Nice, coz I‚Äôm all in for AI to become more accessible and cheaper to run for us all.
