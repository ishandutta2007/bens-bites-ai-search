Daily Digest #301

Hello folks, here‚Äôs what we have today;

###### **PICKS**

1. I wrote[a business deep-dive on Replicate, the AI platform enabling entrepreneurs to make millions per year.](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/story-replicate-350m-company-powering-milliondollar-ai-companies)They‚Äôre valued at $350M and I did some real digging into the early days and how they got to where there they are.

2. [Google launched Gemini out of the blue yesterday.](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)\*\*Gemini is trained on text, images, and audio together.\*\*It comes in three sizes: Ultra (beats GPT-4), Pro (powers Bard now) and Nano (for mobile devices).

   In the benchmarks, all I see are blue numbers under Gemini with GPT-4 (and GPT-4 Vision) greyed out on the side. Google has proved that a model**beating GPT-4 is possible**but again, ships a (kinda) waitlist.üçø[The balanced take you need](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/googles-gemini-beats-gpt4-cost)(also below)

3. Sam Altman is[TIME‚Äôs CEO of the year.](https://time.com/6342827/ceo-of-the-year-2023-sam-altman?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)They made a new category, because Taylor Swift is the Person of the Year.

4. Meta has released a[standalone tool for Emu](https://imagine.meta.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)‚Äîits image generation models.

5. PS: highlighting again.[Elon Musk has raised $135M for xAI](https://x.com/bentossell/status/1732486439315579241?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)and wants to go up to $1B.

[Google launched Gemini out of the blue yesterday.](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-gemini-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)Well, not that out of the blue‚ÄîThe Information first reported that Google is postponing this launch to January and then updated the report to say nope, Google‚Äôs gonna do it this week.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ffc003ed-f840-4426-9dbf-dcde9f18aee3/image.png?t=1701954309)

**And Google launched, with a bang.**

I click on the announcement post and all I see are blue numbers under Gemini with GPT-4 (and GPT-4 Vision) greyed out on the side. Impressive stuff from Google. (TLDR at the bottom)

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/d32b7dc4-eeea-4f3c-8d85-139432c24672/image.png?t=1701954291)

**This looks pretty bad, right?**

But for whom‚Ä¶

As the demo-induced excitement takes some rest, I (and the rest of AI Twitter) dive into the post and find some troubling things.

- The MMLU performance which Google claims surpasses GPT-4 (and even humans) is a clever play on prompting technique, Otherwise, Gemini is still losing to GPT-4. Almost near GPT-4, but losing.

- The flagship demo is a post-processed video (expected) with prompts read in the video different from actual prompts to the system (unexpected). Google reveals this on its own, by releasing a dev post ‚ÄúHow it‚Äôs made‚Äô breaking down how they created the video.

- The blue numbers are for Gemini Ultra, which is gonna come next year. The model is live right now in Bard is Pro, one version down. The developer access for even Pro models is a week away (13th December).

**What exactly did Google launch then?**

Let‚Äôs take a deep breath and think step by step.üòè

The biggest breakthrough in the Gemini announcements is the fact that Gemini models are trained on[multimodal data from the ground up.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jV1vkHv4zq8\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)This includes text, images, videos and audio. This change might result in Google getting a lead and OpenAI play catch up in 2024.

Gemini comes in three sizes: Ultra, Pro and Nano. Ultra beats GPT-4 on many benchmarks and is comparable on the rest. But we are not getting Ultra anytime soon. We‚Äôre[getting Pro in Bard](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-try-gemini-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back), starting now. The kids in this party of giants, the[Nano models will run on mobile devices](https://blog.google/products/pixel/pixel-feature-drop-december-2023/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)starting with the Pixel 8 Pro.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8ddb55ec-3350-4ff0-84d3-445b5ea3165c/image.png?t=1701953736)

Gemini Pro will be in developers‚Äô hands next week. Android devs will also get access to Gemini Nano. Gemini Ultra‚Äôs first appearance next year would be in a different product called Bard Advanced. It‚Äôll likely combine these features and be paid.

The highlight of Benchmark performance is MMLU beating GPT-4 and Humans. They use a new prompting + reward technique to get to 90% on MMLU \[[technical report](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_1_report.pdf?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)]

Google's performance on vision and audio benchmarks is more impressive. Pro with Vision is comparable to GPT-4 with Vision, and Gemini wins over Whisper by a huge margin. But as we all know those are benchmarks. We tried[replicating Gemini tests in ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/Keshavatearth/status/1732477941811212696?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)and felt GPT-4 did as well as the demo videos.

**Ah! The demos. Tell me more**

The key demo,[Hands-on with Gemini](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIZAiXYceBI\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back), shows Gemini using image and audio inputs, working in multiple languages, writing code, and reasoning using images or videos as context. Obviously, the demo is cherry-picked and sped up with post-production (like audio outputs). Google‚Äôs[behind-the-scenes article](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/12/how-its-made-gemini-multimodal-prompting.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)explains how much.

But there are about a dozen other demos buried below this one. A quick recap of the interesting ones:

- Gemini allows scientists to[scan through 200,000 papers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sPiOP_CB54A\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back), find ~250 relevant ones and extract data from those papers.

- A special version of Gemini,[AlphaCode2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvGmVmHv69s\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)performs better than 85% of humans in competitive programming.

- It can check your kids‚Äôs[science homework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4pX1VAxaAI\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)or help you in listening to[French podcasts.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D64QD7Swr3s\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)

- Gemini can[create UIs on the fly.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5tRc_5-8G4\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-strikes-back)BIG!! They are calling it Bespoke UI in the demo. It‚Äôll be interesting to see if this comes out as a product early next year.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/37b544ef-900b-4322-a1f8-6892a9fa4737/image.png?t=1701954617)

**So what?**

The new suite of Gemini models is impressive. Google proved a model beating GPT-4 is possible but again, ships a waitlist. Gemini‚Äôs integration into Google products remains to be seen.

Bard with Gemini Pro is likely better than the ChatGPT free version. ChatGPT Plus with GPT-4 or Bing in Creative mode (using GPT-4 under the hood) is still better.

That‚Äôs it, the rest of it is drama.
