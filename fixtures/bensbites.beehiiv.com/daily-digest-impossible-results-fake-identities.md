Remember the Vesuvius Challenge? The challenge by Nat Friedman to read Herculaneum scrolls which were charred by a volcano nearly 2,000 years ago.[The tech nerds have done the job](https://scrollprize.org/grandprize?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-impossible-results-fake-identities), with the help of AI.

**What is going on here?**

The Vesuvius Challenge gets its first grand winner, reading old Roman scrolls with AI.

**What does this mean?**

The Vesuvius Challenge dished out a grand prize of a cool $700k to the team of Youssef Nader, Luke Farritor, and Julian Schilliger! Their submission recovered more than 2000 characters from the scrolls (the goal was to recover 4 columns of 140 characters each.)

Btw, wanna know what the part recovered in the scroll says? The author is thinking if the things that are available in lesser quantities afford more pleasure than those available in abundance. He thinks that‚Äôs not the case and writes:

*as too in the case of food, we do not right away believe things that are scarce to be absolutely more pleasant than those which are abundant*

Bloomberg has amazing coverage of the[backstory of the challenge.](https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-ai-unlock-ancient-world-secrets/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-impossible-results-fake-identities)

**Why should I care?**

Think about it: if AI can read ancient, crispy scrolls, what can't it do? Yeah, it's about Roman Empire now, but tomorrow? Who knows!

Maybe figuring out medical mysteries or even understanding signals from outer space. It's showing us that AI's not just for support chatbots and spreadsheets; it could help us solve some of the biggest puzzles out there. It's a wild ride, and AI's just getting started.

[Microsoft's diving deep into the AI + news game with Semafor.](https://www.ft.com/content/b521a662-a272-49a1-b76e-3deea4754b76?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-impossible-results-fake-identities)Microsoft's funding a project named["Signals"](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/05/2024/introducing-semafor-signals?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-impossible-results-fake-identities)under Semafor, aiming to bring AI into the newsroom.

**What is going on here?**

Microsoft is partnering with Semafor, leveraging AI to innovate in news production amidst a looming legal battle with the New York Times.

**What does this mean?**

Signals is aiming to drop about a dozen global news perspectives daily, crafted by humans but powered by AI research tools. Think of it as AI doing the legwork so journalists can craft more nuanced stories. Plus, Microsoft is also buddying up with journalism schools and organizations to spread the AI love.

But it's not all smooth sailing. The media world's on edge about AI muscling in, fearing traffic and revenue dips. The New York Times is already suing Microsoft and OpenAI on the claim of freeloading off its content.

**Why should I care?**

AI is being integrated into traditional sectors like journalism. AI being included in the process will certainly raise more questions about how is bias being checked, how much we consume that information and what about copyright.

But the approach of all these partnerships (previously OpenAI with AP News and Alex Springer) is to use AI for research and let journalists do their jobs better.
