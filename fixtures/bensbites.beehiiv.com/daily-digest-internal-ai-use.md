It‚Äôs a really fascinating behind-the-scenes of how companies are radically changing because of AI.

###### **QUICK BITES**

[Slack‚Äôs first set of AI features is going live for enterprise users.](https://slack.com/intl/en-gb/blog/news/slack-ai-has-arrived?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-internal-ai-use)Slack's new AI means less time lost hunting for buried information and more time getting work done. Think personalized AI-powered search, instant channel recaps, and thread summaries at your fingertips.

**What is going on here?**

Slack‚Äôs upgrading from AI integrations it tested in 2023 to get some native AI features.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/a01aa5e6-7369-4f19-97f6-6075e38e6fc2/image.png?t=1707997874)

**What does this mean?**

Ask natural questions (like you would someone who knows your org), and Slack AI spits out precise, source-cited answers. No more scrolling through mountains of messages to find your answer.

For skim-reading channels, you can get an AI-generated recap of any channel for that "need-to-know" lowdown. Add in summaries and key points to distil long threads with countless replies and what-ifs. You can jump right in where it matters. Saves a ton of time!

Slack is hosting the LLMs that power these features on their own infrastructure (no deets on whether there‚Äôs GPT-4 under the hood). But the guarantee is that doesn't share customer data or use it to train any AI models. Your company's info stays securely inside Slack.

But what if you were already using cool AI apps? Those will stay integrated seamlessly into Slack with even more on the way!

**Why should I care?**

Get this: Slack's testing shows up to a whopping 97 minutes saved per person each week by using this AI. That's regained time for the work that*really*matters. Slack AI also cuts through your company's info overload, giving you the power to make informed decisions quickly, even on stuff you missed.

This rollout is starting with enterprise users (paid add-on, English only for now). You can[request access](http://slack.com/features/ai/get-access?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-internal-ai-use)to Slack‚Äôs AI features and talk to their sales team.

Hey, some wild stuff here. Know those state-sponsored groups that doomers keep freaking about? Well, some of them were using OpenAI‚Äôs AI models for shady cyber stuff and guess what?[They got the axe.](https://openai.com/blog/disrupting-malicious-uses-of-ai-by-state-affiliated-threat-actors?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-internal-ai-use)

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI busted five state-backed groups misusing their AI services for their cyber ops. The good news is, their results were pretty limited as far as advanced cyberattacks go.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/9e00a9a8-bbbb-45b9-8566-baef46456ae4/image.png?t=1708000102)

**What does this mean?**

OpenAI caught groups from China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia messing around with AI to find open-source information, researching targets, translating documents finding, coding loopholes and spinning up some code-quickies. OpenAI and Microsoft shut them down and used Microsoft‚Äôs Threat Intelligence to track their activities.

OpenAI says that their models actually aren't super useful for complex cyberattacks (yet). But a separate research doing rounds on Twitter showed that[GPT-4 based agents can hack websites](https://arxiv.org/html/2402.06664v1?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-internal-ai-use).

**Why should I care?**

AI tools are sweet, but ‚Äì no surprise ‚Äì bad actors will try to misuse them. State-backed hackers are serious business. OpenAI‚Äôs approach of flagging sus activities and disabling access works for now, but critical web infra should brace itself for more attacks aided by AI.

And no doomers, the solution isn‚Äôt to pause AI. It‚Äôs to have more vigilant checks and stress-testing security systems. You don‚Äôt stop running if the road is thorny, you get good shoes.
