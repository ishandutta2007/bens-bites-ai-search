Hi folks,

Two posts I’ve written so far;**[How Mistral AI, an OpenAI competitor, rocketed to $2Bn in <12 months](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/mistral-ai-openai-competitor-rocketed-2bn-12-months)**and**[How Deel uses AI in its business](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/deel-uses-ai-business)**.*

###### **PICKS**

1. The NY Times Lawsuit Against OpenAI[Would Open Up The NY Times To All Sorts Of Lawsuits](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/12/28/the-ny-times-lawsuit-against-openai-would-open-up-the-ny-times-to-all-sorts-of-lawsuits-should-it-win/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-the-lawsuit-is-silly)Should It Win. Some key points debated include:

   - Whether the models truly have copies of copyrighted works stored internally or are just narrowly prompted to reproduce specific works.

   - If narrow prompting to reproduce a work is still considered copyright infringement under law.

   - Whether the entity prompting the model or the model/company that created it would be liable in a copyright case.

   - Comparisons made to tools like photo editors, and debates over if the tool creator could be liable for copyright infringement based on a user's actions with the tool.

   - Microsoft and OpenAI may have a public falling out due to competitive tensions.

   - An AI startup that was once successful may be acquired or shut down as funding becomes more difficult to obtain.

   - The dominance of transformer models in generative AI may be challenged by new non-transformer models like Mamba.

   - AI-generated misinformation could impact the 2024 US presidential election.

   - Generative AI may start to be applied to physical devices like robots and wearables.

   - China may develop powerful new AI chips to reduce its reliance on US technology.
