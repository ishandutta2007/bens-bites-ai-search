###### **QUICK BITES**

Nvidia has announced AI-ready versions of its[consumer-grade chips](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/08/nvidia-rtx-4060-super-rtx-4070-ti-super-rtx-4080-super-announced.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-local-ai-personal-ai). To top that up, they have shared multiple[resources and developer tools](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/supercharging-llm-applications-on-windows-pcs-with-nvidia-rtx-systems/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-local-ai-personal-ai)to bring AI to your local computer in 2024.

**What is going on here?**

Nvidia announced three new consumer AI chips and local AI tools.

**What does this mean?**

The three new chips are the ‚Äúsuper‚Äù version of Nvidia‚Äôs RTX 40 series. RTX 4060 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4080 Super range between $599 and $999. These GPUs have additional tensor cores that can run generative AI applications. Nvidia will also provide these in Laptops from companies such as Acer, Dell and Lenovo.

Using Nvidia‚Äôs TensorRT-LLM inference backend you can run these models locally or change a single line of code to seamlessly run models in the cloud or locally on the PC, with the TensorRT-LLM OpenAI Chat API Wrapper. Nvidia offers end-to-end developer tools to train LLMs with custom data in the cloud and quantize them for best performance on RTX PCs, all stitched together with AI Workbench.

**Why should I care?**

The demand for Nvidia‚Äôs larger GPUs such as A100s and H100s are through the roof already. But those chips are for AI companies to train and serve their models for mass usage via the cloud. It felt like AMD and Nvidia will take the cake in consumer AI hardware but Nvidia has deep plans there too.

With new AI-ready graphics cards and developer tools to make it easy to build with local LLMs, we could see Nvidia being the first choice of many people as we go ahead.

[Tab, a new wearable AI necklace](https://www.fastcompany.com/91007630/avi-schiffmanns-tab-ai-necklace-has-raised-1-9-million-to-replace-god?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-local-ai-personal-ai)created by Avi Schiffmann wants to be like a personal AI buddy. Tab is a voice-powered necklace that listens to your conversations and gives you insights about your life and relationships. It has just raised $1.9 million in funding.

**What is going on here?**

Tab wants to be an always-on AI friend that replaces stuff like life coaching and therapy by understanding users' lives through constant listening.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6ae85e0d-b8e0-4b1f-96eb-f74809c0b521/image.png?t=1704894889)

**What does this mean?**

Tab works by hanging around your neck and recording sound of your chats. It uses AI like ChatGPT to type up these convos and track details about you. The goal is for Tab to learn your context and give you personalized insights without you asking specific questions.

Avi‚Äôs Tab has a different approach from Humane‚Äôs Ai pin and Rabbit‚Äôs R1. It‚Äôs not competing with a phone, instead, it‚Äôs about making AI personal to you: your companion, your helper and your guide.

Schiffmann thinks Tab can build a deeper bond than regular apps by being there all the time. He envisions it evolving into a virtual therapist, coach or someone you confide in. Tab only records sound, not video, to balance privacy and collecting useful data.

**Why should I care?**

If Tab works well, it could start a new way of ambient, assistive AI. Instead of needing to ask a chatbot questions, Tab aims to understand your life patterns and needs more naturally. This raises interesting questions around constant surveillance, but also potential upsides like self-improvement and emotional support.

While new, Tab represents a vision of AI as a life enhancing companion versus just a tool. Its impact spans areas like mental health, productivity and relationships. Tab's launch will be an important test case for passive, intimate AI in people's daily lives.
