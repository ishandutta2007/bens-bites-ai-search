###### **QUICK BITES**

\*\*ElevenLabs,\*\*the AI voice cloning startup, is giving voice actors more control and earning potential with their voices. The platform wants to make it easy to[generate your voice clone and get paid when people use it.](https://elevenlabs.io/voice-actors?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-love-in-the-air)

**What is going on here?**

Voice actors can make passive income by sharing their voices on the ElevenLabs platform.

**What does this mean?**

The pitch from ElevenLabs is simple: Turn your talent into passive income. ElevenLabs lets you create an AI clone of your voice and put it to work earning you money.

\*\*Effortless voice cloning:\*\*No more endless studio sessions. just 30 mins of audio lets them build a high-quality AI replica of your voice.

\*\*The Voice Library:\*\*It's like a marketplace where you list your voice clone for others to use in their projects. Voice actors remain the owners of their authentic voices. ElevenLabs has moderation guardrails to prevent misuse of your voice and options for you to customize these filters.

\*\*You pick the payout:\*\*Cash rewards or payments by character usage‚Äîthe choice is yours, and you can set your own custom rates as well.

**Why should I care?**

Taking away creative jobs is one of the main criticisms today. Artists, photographers, voice actors‚Äîeveryone hates AI because it can take away their primary source of earning.

With this program, you can think of it like this: your real voice does the client work, and your AI voice handles the side hustle. Long-term effects of AI creating content are hard to get right, but in the meanwhile payout programs like this open up a whole new revenue stream, instead of taking away work.

[AI's getting pretty good at the whole romance thing](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240211785791/en/McAfee-Research-Reveals-Love-Bytes-45-of-Men-Will-Turn-to-AI-to-Write-Love-Messages-this-Valentine%E2%80%99s-Day?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-love-in-the-air). More people are using AI to write heartfelt messages and enhance their dating profiles, but scammers are also getting wise, crafting fake identities and love scams that are harder to spot. McAfee's survey is spilling the tea.

**What is going on here?**

AI is making it easier to find (or fake) love online, but trust is harder to come by.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/ea6f9881-5dda-4f3e-91b6-9977703c99b6/image.png?t=1707827519)

**What does this mean?**

AI love is in the air! More people are using AI to write heartfelt messages and enhance their dating profiles.

This year, dudes are especially down with AI. Nearly 45% of guys (and 39% of all adults) will use AI tools to write their love messages on Valentine's Day. Why? Because it works! 69% of people got better responses using AI-generated content. Also, 30% of men and 27% of women are using AI bazooka on their online dating profiles.

But 57% would be offended if they found out their sweet nothings were bot-generated. And two-thirds (64%) would lose trust if someone uses AI photos on their profiles.

[¬ª More stats](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240211785791/en/McAfee-Research-Reveals-Love-Bytes-45-of-Men-Will-Turn-to-AI-to-Write-Love-Messages-this-Valentine%E2%80%99s-Day?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-love-in-the-air)on online dating and safety from the survey.

**Why should I care?**

Dating (especially online) is a minefield of AI tacos now. Scams were always there, but folks, you gotta be a lot savvier about communicating this usage with your loved ones. Using AI to express your genuine feelings better is a good thing. Like singing a[song that AI made](https://vdaysong.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-love-in-the-air)for your connection. Just make sure that your partner is on board with this.

And I‚Äôm praying for y‚Äôall coming across AI images. Even I can‚Äôt tell which ones are real.
