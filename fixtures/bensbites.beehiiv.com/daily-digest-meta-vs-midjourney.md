Daily Digest #287

Hello folks, here‚Äôs what we have today;

###### **PICKS**

1. [Meta has announced new AI research into generating videos](https://ai.meta.com/blog/emu-text-to-video-generation-image-editing-research/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-meta-vs-midjourney)from text prompts and precisely editing images via text instructions. The Emu image models from Meta are expanding with\*\*Emu Video and Emu Edit.\*\*üçø[Our Summary](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/meta-shows-new-image-video-generation-models)(also below)

2. [AI can improve breast cancer detection rates](https://www.ft.com/content/d3b462a3-8085-43d7-9e37-a78564907d2c?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-meta-vs-midjourney)compared to human radiologists alone.**AI analysis caught 13% more breast cancers**than radiologists in a study of 25,000 mammograms, proving it's an effective safety net.üçø[Our Summary](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/ai-improves-breast-cancer-detection)(also below)

3. \*\*Updates on Google Gemini - The stars aren't aligned.\*\*The Information reported that it‚Äôs now telling cloud customers to[expect Gemini in Q1 2024 instead](https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/google-delays-cloud-release-of-gemini-ai?rc=bdorru\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-meta-vs-midjourney)of the end of November.[In an interview,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s4PKv2SQzU\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-meta-vs-midjourney)Sundar Pichai also hinted that Gemini will be released in a phased approach.

   That means a**Gemini 1.0 model first and then other ‚Äúpowers‚Äù**(as I like to call them) like multimodality, memory and more. Sundar said that Gemini 1.0 will be a state-of-the-art model, and that makes me more worried than excited. Scared that Google‚Äôs promising too much and will deliver too little, too late.

[Meta has announced new AI research into generating videos](https://ai.meta.com/blog/emu-text-to-video-generation-image-editing-research/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-meta-vs-midjourney)from text prompts and precisely editing images via text instructions. The Emu image models from Meta are expanding with Emu Video and Emu Edit.

**What is going on here?**

Meta‚Äôs new models can generate high-quality videos and edit images.

[more video demos](https://ai.meta.com/blog/emu-text-to-video-generation-image-editing-research/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-meta-vs-midjourney)

**What does this mean?**

The new Emu Video model can generate high-quality 512x512 4-second videos from text prompts alone. The model uses a simplified "factorized" approach that splits video generation into two steps: generating images from text, and then video from images+text. This allows efficient training with diffusion models.

Emu Edit lets users precisely edit images by providing text instructions. It focuses on altering only relevant pixels so the rest of the image stays unchanged. The key insight is incorporating vision tasks as instructions enables unprecedented control. Emu Edit achieved state-of-the-art performance on various edit tasks in evaluations.

**Why should I care?**

Look at every research from Big Tech companies from the perspective of their existing products. Meta launched AI stickers first with the Emu image models. A very chat/conversation-based product. Now imagine the addition of Emu Video features into reels and Emu Edit into reels. If you‚Äôre a user of those products/building for these products you can plan how they‚Äôll fit into your workflow.

New research shows[AI can improve breast cancer detection rates](https://www.ft.com/content/d3b462a3-8085-43d7-9e37-a78564907d2c?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-meta-vs-midjourney)compared to human radiologists alone.

**What is going on here?**

AI analysis caught 13% more breast cancers than radiologists in a study of 25,000 mammograms, proving it's an effective safety net.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/66dcebc0-4778-4b6c-a599-4de546658b65/image.png?t=1700216855)

**What does this mean?**

The AI tools called Mia spotted cancers radiologists missed, demonstrating it complements human expertise. The research let radiologists use the tool in three different ways, resulting in 5%, 10% and 13% more detections. The additional flags identified invasive cancers that are likely to spread, i.e. it has life-saving potential.

AI addition also made the diagnosis process 45% faster. Mia is being used at 16 hospitals in the UK and is being rolled out in the US.

**Why should I care?**

Missed breast cancers cause avoidable death and suffering. AI offers a solution to improve detection worldwide. You should welcome new tech if it catches disease sooner when treatment is more successful.

With faster diagnosis, doctors can also cater to a larger population. Using AI as an additional tool with the radiologists in the loop can give patients reassurance. Still, more work can be done to show how AI reaches decisions before fully trusting it.
