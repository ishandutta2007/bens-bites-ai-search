###### **QUICK BITES**

Elon‚Äôs 4-month-old company[xAI has announced its first LLM - Grok.](https://x.ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-musk-ai-is-born)I am 63.2% sure Elon had a competition with a chicken on who can lay eggs (LLMs) faster. Anyway, the new model will soon be available to Twitter‚Äôs Premium+ ($16/mo) subscribers.

**What is going on here?**

Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI announced their first large language model Grok.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/2b4216e7-2985-48ec-a736-fb6c5efaff95/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

xAI trained Grok-0 (33B) and Grok-1 models in these 4 months. The Grok-1 model will power the[consumer-facing product ‚ÄúGrok‚Äù](https://grok.x.ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-musk-ai-is-born). It‚Äôs essentially a GPT-3.5 competitor beating GPT-3.5, Inflection-1, and LLaMA 2 70B on different benchmarks. Grok-1 is still behind PaLM 2, Claude 2 and way behind GPT-4.

But, Grok has Elon as its hype man and he is on a streak to promote Grok on a different set of benchmarks:

- It has real-time access to information via X (Twitter).

- It‚Äôll respond with sarcasm and humour (and sometimes, swear words).

- It won‚Äôt dump you with a letter signed by ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a large language model‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Grok, the name is from a sci-fi book*Stranger in a Strange Land*and AI is inspired by*Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy*. Don‚Äôt know what means, but just letting you know.ü§∑

**Why should I care?**

Okay, jokes aside. It‚Äôs the first product from the team in just 4 months. There‚Äôll definitely be room for improvement and I don‚Äôt think the team will have to worry about resources. (Elon is still the richest man on Earth). The comparison tweets are not worth looking at right now. They are either fans cherry-picking examples or angry people complaining about it.

The most impressive part of this launch is integration with X. Real-time information from not just the news websites but X user posts could end up being a key detail. And then the availability for X subscribers will take it to non-professional consumers (similar to Meta adding personas in IG).

Though you might not care, I like the naming and science fiction inspirations. (That too in a positive light for once, after all the doomer debates.)

Open AI‚Äôs Dev Day is happening\*\*TODAY.\*\*The keynote will start streaming at 10 AM PST,[tune in here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-musk-ai-is-born)The Decoder compiled[major leaks](https://the-decoder.com/openais-massive-chatgpt-updates-leak-ahead-of-developer-conference/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-musk-ai-is-born)for the event and we have the summary you need.

## What‚Äôs Open AI cooking?

The biggest leak is**custom chatbots**‚Äîwith two new tools Gizmo and Magic Create.

Gizmo packs the punch with all the create your custom chatbot features: add external knowledge files to fine-tune on, define custom actions that you chatbot can do, access browsing and coding tools, and test the chatbots in a sandbox. Gizmo will also have all the basic management features like analytics, drafts, sharing and marketplace for these chatbots. There‚Äôs less info on Magic Create, but it serves similar features by creating chatbots iteratively.

My hunch is that Gizmo will be a separate tool and Magic Create a mode in ChatGPT as some sort of V2 of custom instructions. Talking about ChatGPT, here‚Äôs what might be coming:

- Team Plan for ChatGPT - $30/month/user. $25/month for annual subscriptions. Minimum 3 members. Unlimited usage, longer context windows and privacy benefits.

- Workspace to ChatGPT - Seperate your personal and professional ChatGPT usage.

- Context Connectors: Connect your Google Drive and Microsoft Office.

- All tools - Use different modes (browsing, coding, DallE-3) in a single chat. Already rolled out to some users.

Not a leak but the community is also expecting Vision API. Again, the event is happening TODAY. And we‚Äôll let you know all the final deets tomorrow.
