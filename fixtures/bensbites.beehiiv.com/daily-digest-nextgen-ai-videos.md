Daily Digest #333

Hello folks, here‚Äôs what we have today;

###### **PICKS**

1. I wrote a deep dive on[how Clearbit‚Äôs team uses AI](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/clearbits-team-uses-ai). Clearbit is a data enrichment company,**acquired by Hubspot last year for $150M**. Here‚Äôs what I took away from my conversation with Joao, the Director of AI:

   - exploring use cases with an AI champion in charge

   - rolling it out to the team by forming small, cross-functional teams and speaking with external experts

   - the challenges you‚Äôll face when doubling down on AI implementation in your product and team

   - which tools they use and why

   - leveraging AI agents to automate your life and get time back

   - how much AI has changed the way different teams work

   - steps for AI adoption in your team

###### **QUICK BITES**

We're diving into the world of[AI and news media](https://www.wired.com/story/most-news-sites-block-ai-bots-right-wing-media-welcomes-them/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-next-gen-ai-videos). The gist? Top news outlets, especially the mainstream ones, are blocking AI data collection bots, but right-wing media outlets are saying, "Come on in."

**What is going on here?**

Nearly 90% of leading news platforms are shutting their doors on AI bots, while their right-wing counterparts are rolling out the welcome mat.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/62aa32fa-a28b-4884-95d3-5be232081ddc/image.png?t=1706185276)

**What does this mean?**

Okay, so major players like The New York Times and The Guardian are part of this blockade. They're trying to control how their content feeds into AI systems. Meanwhile, right-wing sites like Breitbart aren‚Äôt bothered about blocking these bots.

Researchers are speculating this might be a tactical move to influence AI models, considering these models learn from the content they consume. Also, right-wing media isn't too involved in the copyright scuffle that's got places like The New York Times at odds with AI companies.

**Why should I care?**

Here's why this matters to you: If you're into AI, tech, or just keeping up with the digital world, this is a big deal. It's about who gets to feed information into the ever-growing AI brain. This clash between media giants and AI firms could shape the future of how information is processed and presented by AI systems. We're looking at a tug-of-war over digital influence, and it's happening right now.
