###### **QUICK BITES**

[Google is adding new features in SGE](https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-generative-ai-october-update/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-da-vinci), Search Generative Experience, its version of AI in Google Search. Now you can generate images and write your first draft right inside Google Search.

**What is going on here?**

Google is adding image and drafting capabilities to its Search AI.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/78a2c0a1-6fe5-4f87-936d-23e582a65d3d/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

You can create images when you search for terms similar to image generation prompts, like ‚Äúphotorealisitic image of a cute bear‚Äù. You can refine the generated images by editing the text prompt in a chat mode after the first generation. The image tab in search results will also occasionally have a ‚Äúcreate something new‚Äù card when you‚Äôre looking for image inspiration.

Google will also launch an ‚Äú[About this image](https://blog.google/products/search/about-this-image-google-search/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-da-vinci)‚Äù tool soon that will help in identifying AI-created images (based on assigned labels).

Additionally, for longer research sessions, the AI can provide written drafts to capture ideas and save time. For instance, it can generate a note to a contractor based on a garage renovation project research trail. You can export these drafts to Google Docs and Gmail.

**Why should I care?**

These features are only available for US users in English. Though terrible name (SGE), I‚Äôve found it is actually helpful for Googling stuff: when I need to find stuff that I think will be deep inside some web result. Not so much, when I want to imagine something new.

Based on that previous experience, the first drafts could be a good addition. For the images, I think comparing web images and your generation side by side could be an interesting aspect.

[Google joins the line of big companies providing legal assurance to](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/protecting-customers-with-generative-ai-indemnification?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-da-vinci)[their customers using its generative AI services](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/protecting-customers-with-generative-ai-indemnification?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-da-vinci). The protections aim to give customers more confidence in using AI tools like Duet AI and Vertex AI.

**What is going on here?**

Google Cloud is offering new legal protections for customers using its generative AI services.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/573db5eb-8447-445c-87dc-6a51190e1ff7/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

The new protections are two-fold. First, Google Cloud is explicitly clarifying that it is not violating any third-party IP rights in training its model. In simple terms, this protects customers from claims based on Google's use of training data.

Second, Google Cloud is adding a new indemnity covering the generated output of certain AI services like Duet AI and Vertex AI. This protects customers from claims related to output generated by Google's AI tools, assuming responsible use.

**Why should I care?**

Microsoft and Adobe have made these announcements already. These new legal protections address a major concern for companies adopting generative AI - the risk of intellectual property claims related to generated content. With Google Cloud also joining in, Amazon is left now.

Remember these are for Google Workspace and Vertex AI use (i.e. Google Cloud customers). Bard and Search AI are not covered in this protection.

###### **QUICK BITES**

Open AI is holding its first developer conference in November and Reuters‚Äô report say that[OpenAI plans to roll out major updates](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-plans-major-updates-lure-developers-with-lower-costs-sources-2023-10-11/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-google-da-vinci)soon in order to attract more developers.

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI wants to make its AI models cheaper and easier for developers to build applications with.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c9e3d952-6bb8-400e-9d72-99c198c59635/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

First, OpenAI could add memory storage capabilities to reduce computing costs for developers (with estimates that this could cut expenses by up to 20 times). Big deal!

Second, the new GPT-4V is likely to be offered in the API. That‚Äôll open up a huge number of new use cases, attracting developers to build on it. allow developers to build apps that can analyze images and describe them. This unlocks many potential use cases beyond just text generation.

**Why should I care?**

OpenAI has the most developer-friendly interface to work with. They recently improved the UI for their cookbook, launched a fine-tuning dashboard and some other minor updates in a similar direction. The se updates from OpenAI hint that devs are still one of their key focus areas (despite the consumer success of ChatGPT).
