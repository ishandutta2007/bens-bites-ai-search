The hottest company in Silicon Valley, the company that promised God-level AGI is providing a drama whose script can only be written by AGI. The last we tuned in, OpenAI Board and staff were at a standoff.

Reports say that the staff got two different explanations, none of which satisfied them. 743 of the ~770 OpenAI employees, including Ilya Sutskever have signed the letter for the board to resign.

**Statement: Satya Nadella talks to the media after hiring Sam Altman into Microsoft.**

On a mini-media tour with[Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut9zcpOEGgc\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-openai-isn-t-dead-not-just-yet),[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/20/microsoft-ceo-nadella-says-openai-governance-needs-to-change-no-matter-where-altman-ends-up.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-openai-isn-t-dead-not-just-yet)and[Kara Swisher](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4i4lKsKevNSGEUnuu7Jzn6?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-openai-isn-t-dead-not-just-yet), Nadella talked about what went down and what are his plans.

- I‚Äôm not being told about anything about \[what Sam did] (1). Open AI‚Äôs governance needs to change after this ‚Äùevent‚Äù (2).

- There is no OpenAI without Microsoft leaning in to partner in a deep way. We have everything to serve our customers if Open AI disappeared tomorrow (3).

- We are open for Sam and Greg to go back to Open AI, but they‚Äôll keep doing business with Microsoft in any case (1). I‚Äôm open to both options (2).

- We have a place for every OpenAI employee that wants to come to Microsoft. And will keep supporting the ones who choose to stay at OpenAI (3).

In addition, Sam Altman tweeted that both his and Satya‚Äôs priority is to keep OpenAI thriving.

**Report: OpenAI staff got different examples from the board for ‚Äúhis not candid communication‚Äù**\[[source](https://www.businessinsider.com/openais-employees-given-explanations-why-sam-altman-out-2023-11?IR=T\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-openai-isn-t-dead-not-just-yet)]

The examples given are:

1. Altman gave two people at OpenAI the same project.

2. Altman gave two board members different opinions about a member of personnel.

The employees are not buying these (evident from the 95% of them being ready to walk if Sam isn't brought back.

**Report: Customers reached out to OpenAI competitors.**\[[source](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-customers-consider-defecting-to-anthropic-google-cohere?rc=bdorru\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-openai-isn-t-dead-not-just-yet)]

While the team is keeping OpenAI operational, more than 100 OpenAI customers contacted OpenAI competitor Anthropic over the weekend.
