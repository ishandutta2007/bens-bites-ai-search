[Atlassian has released the first set of AI capabilities](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/atlassian-intelligence-ga?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-that-was-quick)across its products like Jira, Confluence, and Bitbucket under the name Atlassian Intelligence. Atlassian Intelligence is available to customers with features like summaries, natural language to JQL, virtual agents and more coming soon.

**What is going on here?**

Atlassian is adding AI across its products to transform teamwork through human-AI collaboration.

**What does this mean?**

As an individual user, you can now generate plan drafts, and summarize issues to get work done faster. AI definitions for projects and terms are coming soon.

For team-level collaboration, you have features like Q\&A with AI-generated answers based on org-wide knowledge sources. Anyone in the team can use natural language to JQL or SQL, freeing up data engineers‚Äô time and increasing team velocity.

Virtual agents can run in Slack, get your request and More types of virtual agent behaviours are coming soon.

Early customers like Domino's and Ovo Energy reported productivity gains from virtual teammates who can perform actions like granting you access to a document file.

**Why should I care?**

Devs who were thinking managers are over in post AI world‚Ä¶well, ‚Ä¶ they got even more tools to create tickets to add to your misery. Just kidding, the demo GIFs look really helpful.

Atlassian is one of the biggest providers of office productivity tools. Adding the AI features will lead to many PMs trying AI for the first time. One point of concern here is the RAG-powered search. RAG apps are hot topics but they still hallucinate and it‚Äôs even harder to spot one made-up detail in the haystack of correct ones.
