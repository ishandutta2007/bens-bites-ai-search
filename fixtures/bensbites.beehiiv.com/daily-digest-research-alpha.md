For the better part of a decade, Numbers Station has been building AI models with a focus on analytics. Connecting data to humans is complex, and today‚Äôs LLMs do not solve the problem‚Äîin analytics, hallucinations are just called ‚Äúmistakes.‚Äù

Find out how we solve these problems in our newest whitepaper,*Vertically integrated AI is the answer to legacy data problems*.

###### **QUICK BITES**

[Stability AI is introducing a membership model](https://stability.ai/membership?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-research-alpha)for the commercial rights to their AI models. Stability AI‚Äôs CEO Emad Mostaque says that the subscription model is an easy way to sustain the creation of more models while ensuring maximum people can access their models.

**What is going on here?**

Stability AI is launching a membership program to make its AI models more accessible while retaining commercial rights over the core technologies.

**What does this mean?**

There are 3 tiers: free for personal use, $20/month for commercial use by individuals and startups, and custom enterprise pricing.

The professional tier applies to creators, developers and startups with less than $1M in annual revenue, $1M in institutional funding, and 1M monthly active users (all three must apply). If you‚Äôre above that, you need to contact for enterprise pricing.

Currently, the subscription covers three models from Stability ‚Äî SDXL Turbo (text-to-image), Stable Video Diffusion (text-to-video), and Stable LM Zephyr 3B (text-to-text). More pricing tiers and models are expected to come soon under this new membership.

**Why should I care?**

The membership tiers allow anyone from individuals to large companies to benefit from Stability AI's models commercially or personally. This sustains their goal of advancing open AI while retaining control and funding future developments.

As AI becomes more powerful, keeping it accessible, innovative and responsible matters. Stability AI's plan makes state-of-the-art AI available to users based on their needs and budget.
