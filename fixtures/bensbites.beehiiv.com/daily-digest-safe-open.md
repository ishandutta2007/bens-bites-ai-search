###### **QUICK BITES**

Anthropic is the do-godder Witcher of AI and everyone is tossing (coins) billions at it. Amazon tossed $1.5B some weeks back (with a promise of going up to $4B in future) and became its preferred cloud partner. Google was feeling left behind (after being Anthropic‚Äôs early supporter) and now they are also shelling more quids.[Some $2B worth of ‚Äòem.](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/google-commits-2-billion-in-funding-to-ai-startup-anthropic-db4d4c50?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-safe-and-open)

**What is going on here?**

Google is reportedly investing $2B in Anthropic.

**What does this mean?**

According to the Wall Street Journal, Google has invested $500M of these $2B upfront with the rest of the $1.5B over time. I want to know who has the bigger stake in Anthropic now: Google or Amazon. My guess is that Google invested just enough to keep that majority stake.

In total, Anthropic has already got $2B in the past few weeks with $4B more on the horizon. They are sitting on a huge cash pile which, if I‚Äôm to guess, is going into the training of their next model.

**Why should I care?**

Google‚Äôs investment seems weird, again. Google has its flagship model Gemini coming out soon. Much of this investment feels like Google hedging their bets.

Remember the pitch deck from Anthropic that leaked earlier this year? Their claim was that in the upcoming 2-3 years, the leading model providers will be so far ahead that it‚Äôll be impossible to catch them. Obviously, OpenAI is one of those leading providers. With all this cash, Anthropic wants to be another one itself.

Some people are getting[updates to GPT-4](https://twitter.com/ldjconfirmed/status/1718456393026490523?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-safe-and-open)where you can use, Vision, ADA (code interpreter), Browsing and DallE-3 in the same chat. And the other update is making faux investors lose their sleep.

**What is going on here?**

ChatGPT is getting upgrades to how it uses files and tools.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/1e42e7e8-992e-4aea-882d-f95fc0b4a8d0/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

ChatGPT can now accept multiple files of different types at the same time. Many Chat with PDF apps were building their product around these features. As always OpenAI adding this feature was expected and the equally expected was the outrage that ‚ÄúOh! Chat with PDF apps are dead.‚Äù

The tool usage appears as ‚Äúall tools‚Äù in a chat using multiple tools. There are some rumours about another mode called ‚ÄúMagic Create,‚Äù but no deets about that.

**Why should I care?**

Though the drama about your app being dead is not true, you‚Äôve got to care a bit extra after this. Add additional features to your app, innovate on UI, focus on a niche, double down on marketing, you get the idea. There‚Äôs a lot to do.

As a ChatGPT user, I‚Äôve been waiting for the all tools consolidation for a while. Try out the use cases that needed you to switch threads and lose context, it might perform better now.
