[Humane‚Äôs finally launched its AI pin.](https://hu.ma.ne/aipin?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-shaky-demo-for-ai-wearables)Imran and Bethany want to promise you a new type of computing at $699 + $24/mo for the companion app. The \[[demo](https://twitter.com/humane/status/1722668651705430154?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-shaky-demo-for-ai-wearables)] was Apple-inspired but lacked the enthusiasm of Apple launches. The product on the other hand, packs some interesting features.

**What is going on here?**

Humane launches its version of AI wearable -**ai pin**for $699.

**What does this mean?**

The**ai pin**comes with a magnetic battery booster. You can swap out battery packs and have what Humane calls ‚Äúperpetual battery life‚Äù. There are no wake words or always on recordings. Most interactions start with a touch (or two). Privacy is handled by an on-off LED that makes the device stop if you tamper with it.

The ai pin gives you an alternative for everything you use your phone while putting the device in the background. You can make calls, find and play unique music, take photos etc.

Except apps. Instead of apps it gives you AI experiences that run in the cloud. The ‚Äúcatch me up‚Äù feature gets you summaries for messages. There‚Äôs live translation to talk in any language, AI assisted search to find anything, etc. All the AI is, again, powered by OpenAI models.The gesture controls are cool but you have to keep the hand so that the laser ink can project on it.

**Why should I care?**

The product is extremely interesting. It‚Äôs an experiment with a new form, which is easy to dismiss as ‚Äútoo heavy‚Äù, awkward, or ‚Äúnot there yet‚Äù but not many people imagined us all having Airpods in our ears 24x7. The demo is a bit of letdown with the ‚Äúnot-excited‚Äù script and factual mistakes. I believe in hoping on the side that things will improve and it‚Äôs an exciting time for new-gen wearables as a category.

[OpenAI is introducing Data Partnerships](https://openai.com/blog/data-partnerships?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-shaky-demo-for-ai-wearables)to work with organizations to produce public and private datasets for training AI models. It wants to broaden the training data for AI to cover more subjects, industries, cultures and languages so models can better understand and serve all of humanity.

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI is on the lookout for more data for its models via its data partnership program.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/92647377-ac5b-4c8f-89ff-08ebd886b12d/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

OpenAI is already partnering with organizations and governments to contribute data representing specific industries or countries. It has two stated goals for this program: Create an open-source archive of diverse datasets and private datasets to train proprietary OpenAI models.

In turn, Open AI is promising world-class OCR (for PDFs, images etc.) and ASR (for audio and video files) to turn your data future-ready.

**Why should I care?**

AI works if it helps everyone. To make that a reality diverse datasets are a need. Data partnerships can get more representation from areas that don‚Äôt have an active presence on the open web. For countries, it‚Äôs crucial to have a footprint in the systems that are being used globally.

OpenAI says if you have data you wish to keep private but want AI to better understand, you can partner for private datasets. But do you really want to share what might be the only edge a couple of years in the future?

[Anthropic will utilize Google's new TPU v5e chips](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-08/ai-startup-anthropic-to-use-google-chips-in-expanded-partnership?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-shaky-demo-for-ai-wearables)to boost the performance of its Claude natural language model. The company is also reportedly committing to spending $$s on Google Cloud, even after some questionable rival partnerships.

**What is going on here?**

Anthropic‚Äôs committing to Google Cloud and AWS at the same time.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/8abbdba2-18bd-4c00-96a1-21f33621fc72/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

Anthropic is working hard to make OpenAI-Microsoft partnership look small in terms of complexity. Here‚Äôs a quick timeline of partnerships for Anthropic:

Google‚Äôs been their partner from the early days with a significant share. Then comes Amazon investing $1.25B (can go up to $4B) into the startup with public announcements that Anthropic will move to AWS and Amazon chips heavily. We think Google‚Äôs been ditched.

Google invests $0.5B more (can go up to $2B). The situationship is still going on. And now we have claims that Anthropic will spend $3B with Google Cloud and also use their new TPU chips. deal. Dario Amodei, Anthropic‚Äôs CEO has made it clear: no plans for exclusivity, they‚Äôre all just friends with benefits (clouds).

**Why should I care?**

Google always claims its TPU chips as a competitive strength. With clients like Anthropic, Hugging Face and AssemblyAI, that‚Äôs feeling more true than ever (especially when Google‚Äôs own LLM show hasn‚Äôt been that great).

Google says it‚Äôs chill with Anthropic shopping around. And for Anthropic, you can think of 100 other dating puns and it‚Äôll still somehow make sense.
