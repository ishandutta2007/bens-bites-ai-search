###### **QUICK BITES**

[GitHub is transforming into an AI-powered developer platform](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-most-successful-ai-product)centered around GitHub Copilot. They are announcing new Copilot products and features that integrate AI throughout the developer workflow.

**What is going on here?**

GitHub is expanding Copilot into a full AI assistant for developers.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/4692fd5a-943f-438f-91f9-6a8ba12ea716/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

Copilot Chat will be generally available in December, letting developers communicate with AI using natural language to explain code, suggest fixes, and more. This release makes Copilot ubiquitous. It will be available across GitHub products including the code editor, command line interface, website, mobile apps, and 3rd party IDEs like JetBrains.

Copilot will understand both public and private organizational code for tailored suggestions. GitHub is also announcing Copilot Enterprise which connects Copilot to internal code for teams.

GitHub wants Copilot to be an AI companion for developers at every step from idea to deployment. It reduces time spent on mundane tasks so developers can focus on creativity. Copilot will also foster an ecosystem of 3rd party developer tool integrations to expand its capabilities.

**Why should I care?**

This will fundamentally change how software is built. Copilot makes developers more productive by enhancing human creativity with AI. It lowers the barriers for turning ideas into shipped products. Copilot reduces time wasted debugging and understanding complex code. It frees up mental energy to focus on big picture innovation.

For organizations, Copilot Enterprise customizes AI specifically to internal systems and code. This allows developers to ramp up faster and increases velocity. Copilot enables teams to stay ahead of the competition by shipping faster with fewer bugs. Integrating AI throughout the development lifecycle is now a strategic advantage.

[Samsung recently unveiled its new generative AI system called Samsung Gauss](https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-unveils-its-generative-ai-model-samsung-gauss/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-most-successful-ai-product), which consists of language, code, and image models. Gauss currently helps employees via productivity features but will expand to consumer products.

**What is going on here?**

Samsung Gauss represents Samsung's attempt to leverage AI to enhance its products and services. While still in early stages, Samsung plans to integrate Gauss across various offerings.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/71fed0d5-1409-40de-93ed-6b821195a5db/image.png)

**What does this mean?**

By launching Gauss, Samsung is signaling its serious commitment to AI. Given its massive consumer reach, Samsung integrating Gauss across its ecosystem could significantly accelerate everyday people's adoption of generative AI.

Samsung seems to be taking a measured approach by having the AI models strengthen its own operations before consumer rollout. This allows time to address risks like security and data privacy.

**Why should I care?**

For consumers, Samsung launching Gauss could mean AI assistants in your next Samsung phone or fridge. It also represents tech giants embracing AI, which will likely impact services and products industry-wide.

Broader adoption of AI has huge implications. It could enhance convenience but also disrupt industries and raise concerns around misinformation. As a tech leader, how Samsung navigates the AI landscape will set an important precedent.

Scale AI is unveiling a new research initiative called the[Safety, Evaluations, and Analysis Lab](https://scale.com/blog/safety-evaluations-analysis-lab?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-most-successful-ai-product)(SEAL) to establish safety benchmarks and evaluation products for deploying large language models (LLMs).

**What is going on here?**

Scale is ramping up investments in advanced red teaming and evaluation methods to enhance transparency and standardization around LLM safety.

**What does this mean?**

Currently, each AI company establishes safety guidelines in-house, which can be inefficient and overlook key risks. Scale plans to collaborate with regulators and the AI community to develop comprehensive LLM safety evaluation products and benchmarks applicable across the industry. This aims to mitigate common safety risks outlined in the executive order on AI, like cybersecurity and deceptive content. The SEAL team will conduct research to improve evaluation reliability, apply red teaming techniques, and develop LLM-based automated rating systems.

**Why should I care?**

Standardized safety benchmarks will increase accountability and transparency for companies deploying LLMs. More rigorous evaluation methods can help identify and mitigate risks early. As AI becomes deeply integrated into products and services, consumers need assurance LLMs align with ethical principles. More open collaboration on safety practices will also accelerate AI progress responsibly.
