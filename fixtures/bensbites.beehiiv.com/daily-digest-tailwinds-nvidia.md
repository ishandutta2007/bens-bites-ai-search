[Nvidia can't export its best AI chips to China](https://www.wsj.com/tech/nvidias-new-china-pickle-customers-dont-want-its-downgraded-chips-ab98a153?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-tailwinds-for-nvidia)anymore because of US rules. Now its Chinese customers like Alibaba, Tencent, and ByteDance aren't thrilled about buying the lower-powered chips Nvidia's offering instead.

**What is going on here?**

Nvidia‚Äôs Chinese customers are shifting some orders to domestic chipmakers like Huawei.

**What does this mean?**

Nvidia can't export its best AI chips to China anymore because of US rules added last year. To comply, Nvidia whipped up some downgraded chips. Its big Chinese customers in China planned to buy a bunch of these now-banned chips. So they're not too pumped about the lower-powered replacements. Fair I reckon.

As a result, China's big tech firms are taking their business elsewhere. WSJ reported that Huawei scored orders for at least 5,000 Ascend 910B chips (similar to Nvidia‚Äôs A100) AI chips from major Chinese internet companies in 2023. And Alibaba is also working on its own chips in case it can't get Nvidia's anymore.

**Why should I care?**

In the short term, Nvidia's downgraded chips don't have much alpha over China's homegrown options. In the long run, the unpredictable export controls are pushing Chinese companies to ditch Nvidia so their supply doesn't get disrupted.

It's a tricky spot for Nvidia - they wanna keep their Chinese customers happy but also follow the US rules. While Nvidia has short-term demand it can't meet, tightening U.S. export controls pose a major risk to the company's sales growth in China over the next 5 years.

[Microsoft has appointed Deannah Templeton](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-05/microsoft-picks-dee-templeton-as-openai-board-observer?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-tailwinds-for-nvidia)to its observing seat on OpenAI‚Äôs Board.[OpenAI's board has also approached](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-board-has-discussed-seats-with-scale-ais-wang-investor-friedman?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-tailwinds-for-nvidia)Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman about potentially joining.

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI's board is looking to add new members after CEO Sam Altman was fired and then reinstated in November 2022.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/60eebe16-b7d6-4d39-8a7e-6ac3869bba31/image.png?t=1704712429)

**What does this mean?**

Microsoft was granted a non-voting observer seat on OpenAI‚Äôs board after Sam Altman was reinstated as OpenAI‚Äôs CEO last month. Deannah Templeton was a likely pick for this board observer role. As per Bloomberg, she has started to attend the OpenAI board‚Äôs meetings representing Microsoft.

Templeton reports to Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott, who has been the key person in making the OpenAI-Microsoft partnership possible. She was responsible for coordinating aspects of Microsoft‚Äôs partnership with OpenAI over the past year.

OpenAI is also seeking board members from companies it partners with or that work with AI startups. Wang and Friedman were also considered to be interim CEOs when Sam was suddenly fired by OpenAI‚Äôs previous board. Both rejected the offer then and are likely to do the same now.

**Why should I care?**

OpenAI‚Äôs board now consists of former Salesforce CEO Bret Taylor, former U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers and Quora CEO Adam D‚ÄôAngelo. The trio is also overseeing an independent review of the events leading to Altman‚Äôs ouster.

The new board appointments will shape OpenAI's future direction. Board chair Taylor has already clarified that he‚Äôll depart after the new board has been formed.
