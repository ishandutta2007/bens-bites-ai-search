###### **QUICK BITES**

[Meta has released another batch of language translation models](https://ai.meta.com/blog/seamless-communication/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-talk-to-anyone). These ones keep the way we speak intact when translating what we speak. Also, you don‚Äôt have to wait for the translations until you finish speaking, the speech output is almost real-time to speaking.

**What is going on here?**

Meta has released their ‚Äúseamless‚Äù suite of language translation models.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/c527a426-62be-46bf-afc7-196fde83db98/image.png?t=1701431928)

**What does this mean?**

These are four models:

- SeamlessM4T v2 - The foundational model that Meta released in August.

- SeamlessExpressive - A model for preserving expression in speech-to-speech translation.

- SeamlessStreaming - A streaming translation model for state-of-the-art results with around two seconds of latency.

- Seamless - SeamlessExpressive, SeamlessStreaming and SeamlessM4T v2 into one model.

SeamlessExpressive currently keeps speech rate, pauses for rhythm, emotion and style in speech-to-speech translation between English, Spanish, German, French, Italian, and Chinese. SeamlessStreaming translates while the speaker is still talking.

You can[try the models](https://huggingface.co/collections/facebook/seamless-communication-6568d486ef451c6ba62c7724?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-talk-to-anyone)on HuggingFace and the models are open-source for non-commercial use.

**Why should I care?**

Imagine video calls on Instagram with the seamless models. You could chat with anyone in the world without English being the qualifying barrier.

Another part worth noticing is you can build algorithms to enhance base models. For example, Seamless streaming has an algorithm to decide when to keep listening and when to start translating to deal with the different sentence structure in different languages.

###### **QUICK BITES**

OpenAI is moving forward with the tender offer after briefly putting it on hold when CEO Sam Altman was briefly ousted, and then reinstated. This means employees can sell shares in a deal valuing OpenAI at $86 billion. The tender offer[timeline has been extended by a month](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-11-30/openai-tender-for-employee-shares-is-on-and-extended-to-jan-5?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=daily-digest-talk-to-anyone)to January 5th due to recent turmoil.

**What is going on here?**

OpenAI‚Äôs tender offer is being extended to give employees more time.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/46690362-6c30-4596-93dd-18ba1bfadd10/image.png?t=1701432775)

**What does this mean?**

By proceeding with the tender offer, OpenAI is sticking to its plan despite the leadership turmoil. Some investors had dropped out when Altman was fired, but there's now enough demand to cover the deal. OpenAI sees enough interest to cash out employees at an eye-popping $86 billion valuation. The extension gives employees more time to opt in after the chaos. Essentially, early employees can unlock the value of their equity.

**Why should I care?**

The tender offer signals that OpenAI has stabilized after its leadership crisis and remains on track to go public eventually. The soaring valuation cements its status as a hugely valuable AI leader. Safe to say that despite the speed bumps, investor interest in OpenAI is still through the roof.
