# Duolingo cuts 10% of contractors as it uses more AI

[Duolingo is reducing its contractor workforce](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-08/duolingo-cuts-10-of-contractors-in-move-to-greater-use-of-ai?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=duolingo-cuts-10-of-contractors-as-it-uses-more-ai) by using AI for content. Though Duolingo’s use of AI is already public with their partnership with OpenAI for Duolingo Max.

## What's going on here?

Duolingo laid off 10% of its contractors as it uses more AI for content creation.

## What does this mean?

Last week one of the laid-off contractors posted on Reddit about this. A Duolingo spokesperson confirmed it, saying around 10% of contractors got the axe. Duolingo said no full-timers were cut in this move.

There’s more AI coming. The CEO said generative AI will let Duolingo make new content much faster, like instructional video scripts. The company also uses AI for automated feedback and conversations in the app.

## Why should I care?

The spokesperson said the layoffs weren't straight-up AI replacement. AI is used by Duo staff in their work. They just don’t need that many people now. It’s media speak. It's like saying you're going home—only to change clothes before hitting the club.

But don’t get me wrong, AI replacing boring work rather than whole jobs is good. The sad truth is some will lose work short-term (and long-term if we don't evolve with the tech).
