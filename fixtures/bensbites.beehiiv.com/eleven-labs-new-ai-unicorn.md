## What does this mean?

The cash influx is led by big names like Andreessen Horowitz and others. Started in 2022 by a couple of tech-savvy guys, Piotr Dabkowski and Mati Staniszewski, Elevan Labs is one of the leading AI voice companies now. From a modest team of 5, they've scaled up to 40 and are eyeing about 100 by year's end.

They will be rolling out some fancy new tools like a Dubbing Studio for movie buffs, a Voice Library Marketplace for voice creators to earn some dough, and a Mobile Reader App that turns text and URLs into audio in the upcoming weeks.

## Why should I care?

Voice Cloning is a big market and ElevenLabs is a name to watch. Movies, audiobooks, or just browsing the web, their tech could change how you experience media. Plus, if you're in the tech biz or a voice artist, this could open up some exciting opportunities.
