Figma has expanded the [AI integration into its visual collaboration tool FigJam](https://www.figma.com/blog/introducing-ai-to-figjam/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=figjam-ai-brainstorm-with-ai-in-figma) to make it more useful and accessible. It can now help users generate templates, diagrams, and summaries, allowing anyone to create visuals from simple text prompts.

## What’s going on here?

## What does this mean?

The new AI capabilities in FigJam aim to solve two key problems: the "blank canvas" issue where users struggle to start a new file, and making visual collaboration tools more accessible to non-designers. By allowing users to describe their needs in plain language, FigJam can now instantly generate customized templates for weekly meetings, brainstorms, timelines etc.

Second, is the grunt work after brainstorming: it can sort stickies into groups automatically and summarize the discussions to get clarity on the key takeaways and next steps.

# Why should I care?

Combining both you can go from a blank canvas to a personalized FigJam file while keeping your focus and time dedicated to the ideas being discussed, not manual tasks. The AI does the heavy lifting.

For new users, it’ll get them started faster and more experienced users can do more with these features.
