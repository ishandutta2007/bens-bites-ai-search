Hey folks, overwhelmingly positive feedback on the new format so I'm going to stick with it for now.

Grab your cutlery of choice, let's dig in.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- **An AI tool I actually use every day** is finally out in the wild: **Bearly AI**. It lives as a chrome extension or keyboard shortcut to pop up as you‚Äôre in the groove. So think of me looking through tons of **research papers and trying to quickly summarise and simplify** them for you, my beautiful readers. That‚Äôs where I use Bearly. I‚Äôm on an arXiv post, click the little bear, and boom I get a summary that I can use to explain what the paper is talking about. It‚Äôs got a bunch of writing tools baked in; summarisation, rewording, generation etc. ([**link**](https://bearly.ai/))
- **Magician** - **A magical design tool for Figma powered by AI**. Firstly, what a great way to talk about the tool, ‚Äòmagic‚Äô is exactly what a lot of this feels like. You can use this tool to make icons, images and text in your Figma designs. No more lorem ipsum, no more Unsplash, no more going somewhere else to come back and populate in Figma. ([**link**](https://magician.design/)) You can read the announcement blog post [here](https://blog.diagram.com/p/introducing-magician).

- MagicVideo: **Efficient video generation** with latent diffusion models. ([**link**](https://magicvideo.github.io/))
- EDGE - editable dance generation. **Create realistic and physically-plausible dances** from music. Physically-plausible is a stretch for my moves, but still! ([link](https://edge-dance.github.io/))

### **üõ†Ô∏è Cool Tools**

- Clip - **an audio search engine** and soon a way to generate new audio. To be clear, this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúsearch audio from podcasts‚Äù tool, like I thought it was. It‚Äôs more relevant for searching things like ‚Äòocean waves‚Äô. ([link](https://www.clip.audio/))
- **Replace one thing in an image**, with another, **using text-prompts**. ([link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nielsr/text-based-inpainting))

üëã Too many links?! I created a database for all links mentioned in these emails. Refer 1 friend [using this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER) and I'll send over the link database.

### **üî¨ Research**

- Using AI to study **12 years of representation in TV**. The study found that while there has been some progress in terms of representation, there are still significant gaps, particularly for women, older people and people with dark skin tones. ([link](https://blog.google/technology/ai/using-ai-to-study-12-years-of-representation-in-tv/))
- Using reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to **improve upon simulated, embodied agents** trained to a base level of competency with imitation learning. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11602))
- 3D GAN framework for unsupervised learning of generative, high-quality and **3D-consistent facial avatars from unstructured 2D images**. ([link](https://mrtornado24.github.io/Next3D/))

- SinFusion: **Training diffusion models on a single image or video**. ([link](https://yanivnik.github.io/sinfusion/))
- DDCap is designed to be more flexible than existing methods for **image captioning**. The model uses diffusion-based inference, which allows for more efficient decoding of text tokens. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11694))
- **Conditional image synthesis from semantic layouts** of any precision levels, ranging from pure text to a 2D semantic canvas with precise shapes - SceneComposer. ([link](https://zengyu.me/scenec/))
- **Text-to-SVG**. VectorFusion - a text-conditioned diffusion model trained on pixel representations of images can be used to generate SVG-exportable vector graphics. ([link](https://ajayj.com/vectorfusion))
- AR-LDM - designed for **story visualization and continuation tasks**. The model is conditioned on history captions and generated images, and is able to adapt to new characters. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10950))
