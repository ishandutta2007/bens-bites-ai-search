# Figma's way ahead: with AI, without Adobe.

[Figma is betting its AI tools can improve meetings and collaboration](https://www.fastcompany.com/91002435/figjam-is-betting-its-ai-can-make-meetings-less-terrible-even-without-adobes-backing?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=figma-s-way-ahead-with-ai-without-adobe) despite the failed Adobe acquisition. Figma's new AI features like Jambot and FigJam AI aim to make meetings more engaging and productive.

## What's going on here?

Figma is adding AI to its ideation tool FigJam.

## What does this mean?

Adobe was to acquire Figma for $20B. Regulators came in, the deal fell off. But in the past few months, Figma has been aggressively pursuing AI to differentiate itself. It acquired an AI startup called Diagram, held internal hackathons and launched various experimental AI features.

These new tools primarily got added to its product called Figjam—the ideation and collaboration tool. They can now suggest icebreakers, summarize discussions, and rewrite meeting notes. As per Figma, early user response has been very positive, with people embracing the playful creative elements.

## Why should I care?

Figma is expanding beyond its core design audience with AI. Two-thirds of its users are now non-designers. The larger selling point now is improved collaboration and ideation, regardless of technical skills. It won’t be surprising to see startups expand into additional tasks around their main offering.

While the community is constantly hacking on “Figma to code” stuff, we haven’t seen much from Figma itself (apart from some plugins).
