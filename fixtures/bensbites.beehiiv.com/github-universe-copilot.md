# Github Universe is all about Copilot

[GitHub is transforming into an AI-powered developer platform](https://github.blog/2023-11-08-universe-2023-copilot-transforms-github-into-the-ai-powered-developer-platform/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=github-universe-is-all-about-copilot) centered around GitHub Copilot. They are announcing new Copilot products and features that integrate AI throughout the developer workflow.

## Whatâ€™s going on here?

## What does this mean?

Copilot Chat will be generally available in December, letting developers communicate with AI using natural language to explain code, suggest fixes, and more. This release makes Copilot ubiquitous. It will be available across GitHub products including the code editor, command line interface, website, mobile apps, and 3rd party IDEs like JetBrains.

Copilot will understand both public and private organizational code for tailored suggestions. GitHub is also announcing Copilot Enterprise which connects Copilot to internal code for teams.

GitHub wants Copilot to be an AI companion for developers at every step from idea to deployment. It reduces time spent on mundane tasks so developers can focus on creativity. Copilot will also foster an ecosystem of 3rd party developer tool integrations to expand its capabilities.

## Why should I care?

This will fundamentally change how software is built. Copilot makes developers more productive by enhancing human creativity with AI. It lowers the barriers for turning ideas into shipped products. Copilot reduces time wasted debugging and understanding complex code. It frees up mental energy to focus on big picture innovation.

For organizations, Copilot Enterprise customizes AI specifically to internal systems and code. This allows developers to ramp up faster and increases velocity. Copilot enables teams to stay ahead of the competition by shipping faster with fewer bugs. Integrating AI throughout the development lifecycle is now a strategic advantage.
