# Google add image generation and long drafts to Search AI

[Google is adding new features in SGE](https://blog.google/products/search/google-search-generative-ai-october-update/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-add-image-generation-and-long-drafts-to-search-ai), Search Generative Experience, its version of AI in Google Search. Now you can generate images and write your first draft right inside Google Search.

## What's going on here?

Google is adding image and drafting capabilities to its Search AI.

## What does this mean?

You can create images when you search for terms similar to image generation prompts, like “photorealisitic image of a cute bear”. You can refine the generated images by editing the text prompt in a chat mode after the first generation. The image tab in search results will also occasionally have a “create something new” card when you’re looking for image inspiration.

Google will also launch an “[About this image](https://blog.google/products/search/about-this-image-google-search/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-add-image-generation-and-long-drafts-to-search-ai)” tool soon that will help in identifying AI-created images (based on assigned labels).

Additionally, for longer research sessions, the AI can provide written drafts to capture ideas and save time. For instance, it can generate a note to a contractor based on a garage renovation project research trail. You can export these drafts to Google Docs and Gmail.

## Why should I care?

These features are only available for US users in English. Though terrible name (SGE), I’ve found it is actually helpful for Googling stuff: when I need to find stuff that I think will be deep inside some web result. Not so much, when I want to imagine something new.

Based on that previous experience, the first drafts could be a good addition. For the images, I think comparing web images and your generation side by side could be an interesting aspect.
