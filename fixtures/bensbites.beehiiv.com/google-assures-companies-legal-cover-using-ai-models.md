# Google assures companies of legal cover when using their AI models.

The protections aim to give customers more confidence in using AI tools like Duet AI and Vertex AI.

## What's going on here?

Google Cloud is offering new legal protections for customers using its generative AI services.

## What does this mean?

The new protections are two-fold. First, Google Cloud is explicitly clarifying that it is not violating any third-party IP rights in training its model. In simple terms, this protects customers from claims based on Google's use of training data.

Second, Google Cloud is adding a new indemnity covering the generated output of certain AI services like Duet AI and Vertex AI. This protects customers from claims related to output generated by Google's AI tools, assuming responsible use.

## Why should I care?

Microsoft and Adobe have made these announcements already. These new legal protections address a major concern for companies adopting generative AI - the risk of intellectual property claims related to generated content. With Google Cloud also joining in, Amazon is left now.

Remember these are for Google Workspace and Vertex AI use (i.e. Google Cloud customers). Bard and Search AI are not covered in this protection.
