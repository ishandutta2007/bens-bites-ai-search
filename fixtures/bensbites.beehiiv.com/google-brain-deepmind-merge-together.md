[Alphabet merge Google Brain and DeepMind to form a single division](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/20/google-consolidates-ai-research-divisions-into-google-deepmind/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-brain-and-deepmind-merge)

**Google**has just orchestrated a merging of all the big brains and genius within its two flagship departments: Google Brain + DeepMind =**Google DeepMind**. (Not too sure the Brain lot are gonna be too happy with that choice of name .) Anyway, hopefully, the DeepMind half is gonna be able to put the**occasional old dramas**to the side (they‚Äôve typically looked for*more*autonomy from Alphabet) and pull together a wave of AI breakthroughs. Clearly, this is a move to bring a bigger,**more aggressive fight**to Microsoft and OpenAI, and I‚Äôd imagine there‚Äôs gonna be a large focus on using the team to build language models into their**search engine**.

[Humane has received $230m in funding to produce an AI-powered wearable](https://www.axios.com/2023/04/21/humane-ai-powered-wearable?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-brain-and-deepmind-merge)

This**ex-Apple**guy has*very secretly*been raising a lot of funding and has now exploded onto the stage via a TED talk. Having raised a whopping\*\*$230m\*\*,**Humane**has been working on an**AI-powered wearable**device-type-thingy. It uses a combination of voice- and gesture-based interaction, and I guess is kinda like a mini amped-up Siri/Alexa. We‚Äôve seen a couple of these sorts of things developed as personal projects, and they‚Äôre all awesome but always a bit slow - I can‚Äôt wait to see the video of how these look following hundreds of millions in funding. (Looks like the video will be out tomorrow‚Ä¶)

[Stack Overflow start charging big corps for using their content to train models](https://www.wired.com/story/stack-overflow-will-charge-ai-giants-for-training-data/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-brain-and-deepmind-merge)

**StackOverflow**(the coding Q\&A site) has just taken a very significant leaf out of Reddit‚Äôs book. Where Reddit got fed up with OpenAI (and other companies generating chatbots) scraping their online data for free, StackOverflow has decided to follow in their footsteps and announce a**charge for their data**. Given that the ability to answer coding questions is such a huge use-case for ChatGPT-style tools, this could be a serious slower-downer for the development of useful LLMs. The SO CEO has gone a step further, too, accusing OpenAI of**violating their terms of service**, which states that contributors own their own content and require a reference. Well, that clearly hasn‚Äôt happened, has it‚Ä¶

[Anthropic make a bold proposal for how to keep AI safe](https://www.anthropic.com/index/an-ai-policy-tool-for-today-ambitiously-invest-in-nist?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-brain-and-deepmind-merge)

I‚Äôm filled with glee to announce that we‚Äôre ending the week by getting down and dirty with good old**tech regulation**again! This time**Anthropic**, the AI company of ex-OpenAI folk, is taking the lead with a*bold*policy suggestion for how to take things forward. They‚Äôre suggesting that now is the perfect time to ‚Äúaggressively‚Äù fund**NIST**- yep, they‚Äôre the guys behind MNIST, the massive dataset of written digits.

Being responsible for measurements and standards, NIST is perfectly poised to design**fundamental measurement techniques**from a strong foundation in order to measure the safety and**responsibility of AI**. Not only fundamental measurements but also standardisations of development and a testbed for model viability in our human world. It‚Äôs time for rigorous testing, increased public trust, confidence from the government, and proper certification - and NIST are the people to do it.
