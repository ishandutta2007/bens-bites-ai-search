# Google has a secret AI tool

Google’s Gemini is the next awaited model in the AI space. But according to a leak, [Gemini is not the only AI thing Google is working on](https://medium.com/@bedros-p/gemini-is-coming-to-makersuite-so-are-stubbs-32248f3924aa?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-has-a-secret-ai-tool) at the moment. There might be a new tool called Stubbs on Google Makersuite for easily building basic AI prototype apps visually with no code required.

## What's going on here?

Leaks show that Google will launch an AI app generator with its multimodal LLM Gemini.

## What does this mean?

Stubbs could allow users to prototype AI apps with a visual builder. Publish, share and remix options are also in the leaked screenshots meaning you might be able to share prototypes and edit Stubbs shared by others.

Multimodal Gemini may power Makersuite and Google’s Vertex AI, before getting into Bard. It has an answer with an image option which might be generating images (or just including web images in its answers like Bard does). Another product Jetway, which might be just a sub-model of Gemini, could also be able to output HTML content.

## Why should I care?

If you ask any developer building on top of LLMs, they’ll tell you that it’s way easier to work with Open AI’s API. The leaked images of Stubbs show a straightforward platform for creating GenAI apps. This could bring much-needed developer attention to Google’s AI models. Other than that, let’s wait because all of these are just leaks.
