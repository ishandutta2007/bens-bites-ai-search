[Guess what’s latest on Chrome?

## What does this mean?

Chrome's rolling out three AI features.

- **First, there's the Tab Organizer:** Forget the hassle of sorting tabs; Chrome’s got you sorted with automatic smart groupings and even suggests names and emojis for easy identification. Tab organizer uses the page titles and URLs of open tabs in the active window to do this.

- **Next, AI-generated themes:** Create your own vibe with generative AI wallpapers. Choose your mood, style, color, and subject, and voila – a personalized theme just for you. There’s no prompting, so the customization is still limited.

- \*\*Help me write:\*\*The third feature is not there yet in Chrome. But we’ve seen this one. Right-click and select “help me write” to use AI to write. Just that it’ll work on every text-box on Chrome.

## Why should I care?

Big disclaimer: these are experimental features in US only. Google says it’ll come to everyone soon but just FYI. Let’s be honest, themes are meh. Help me write could be useful but depends on the model behind it (likely to be Gemini Pro—equivalent to GPT-3.5). The tab grouping feature stands out the most for me, and I hope it is as good as in the [demo](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/MP4_Tab_Organizer_Chrome.mp4?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-starts-bringing-ai-to-chrome).
