## What does this mean?

Select DeepMind employees working on Google's Gemini model to rival ChatGPT are being given large grants of Google stock that vest in just 1 year, compared to the normal 4 year vesting period. These grants are in addition to salary and bonuses and can be worth millions based on the person.

## Why should I care?

The talent war between Google and OpenAI is crazy and it’s not new. Many key AI researchers at OpenAI have previously worked at Google and led breakthroughs in the AI space. The departures of key personnel could further back Google's efforts to challenge OpenAI, and hence Google is trying to leverage its stock and existing talent pool to stay competitive.
