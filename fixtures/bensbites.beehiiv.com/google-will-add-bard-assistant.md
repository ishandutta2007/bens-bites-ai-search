## What does this mean?

This new assistant aims to make it easier to manage tasks like planning trips, sorting emails, making grocery lists, and sending texts - as a human assistant would. The Assistant as usual will access the web and your apps to bring all the context, over which Bard will reason and generate answers/commands which the Assistant can then carry out. Assistant with Bard will be available as an opt-in after testing.

## Why should I care?

The current lineup of features coming to Bard has been pushing it into a personal assistant direction. Still, accessing Bard via a website on your smartphone is not the ideal UX. Assistant with Bard is the natural progression for Google—the one that can finally create a seamless assistant experience.
