# Google's Bard starts creating images, and I like them.

[Bard's got some cool updates.](https://blog.google/products/bard/google-bard-gemini-pro-image-generation/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-bard-starts-creating-images-and-i-like-them) It now offers Gemini Pro in more countries and can check its answers better, but the biggest of all is image generation. Yup, you can now create images in Bard.

## What's going on here?

Bard's now global with Gemini Pro and can whip up images.

## What does this mean?

So, Gemini Pro, Google’s language model equivalent to GPT 3.5 is now in Bard for over 40 languages and 230+ countries. Similarly, Bard has a double-check feature that checks generated answers against web content to flag incorrect responses. It also works better and in more countries & languages now.

And if that's not enough, Bard's now your personal artist, creating images from your prompts, thanks to the Imagen 2 model. And, Google’s all about embedding digital watermarks in these images, using their tool called Synth ID. (how reliable is that is a topic for another time)

## Why should I care?

Recently Bard with Gemini Pro climbed the charts in a community-driven leaderboard, getting to number 2 just behind GPT-4 Turbo by OpenAI. So users are getting that performance in more languages.

Also, this isn’t Bard Advanced, the version powered by Google’s Gemini Ultra, which it claims beats GPT-4, so we’ll have to see what kind of fight that one brings.

Images are definitely not the best of what’s out there, but it’s free, and in some quick checks I found it more visually appealing than some stuff I got from DallE. So, worth keeping an eye on.
