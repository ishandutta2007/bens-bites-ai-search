Hey folks, this is Ben‚Äôs Bites. Today we have Discord + OpenAI, news about GPT-4 and AI safety and danger. Also, GANs are making a comeback, and we‚Äôll have to see how they do over the weekend.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**[GPT-4 is coming next week ‚Äì and it will be multimodal, says Microsoft Germany](https://www.heise.de/news/GPT-4-is-coming-next-week-and-it-will-be-multimodal-says-Microsoft-Germany-7540972.html)

Microsoft Germany‚Äôs CTO Andreas Braun was at an AI kickoff event yesterday and he mentioned ‚ÄúWe will introduce**GPT-4 next week**, there we will have multimodal models that will offer completely different possibilities ‚Äì for example,**videos**.‚Äù

Now with Sam Altman saying that they‚Äôll release GPT-4 after a long wait in January, this comes as a surprise. So, I‚Äôm not sure if this is**an error, a spoiler or speculation!**

The description of it being multimodal and multilingual is impressive and something I can digest as what we can expect with GPT-4 and Microsoft.

**2/**[Discord starts testing ChatGPT-powered Clyde chatbot and other AI features.](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/9/23631930/discord-openai-clyde-chatbot-automod-features-ai)

Discord announced a **partnership with OpenAI** to improve their bots and introduce thread summarization. However, the news was met with negative feedback due to a recent change in their privacy policy and concerns about turning off the AI features.

For now, they‚Äôve added a paragraph to their [original announcement](https://discord.com/blog/ai-on-discord-your-place-for-ai-with-friends) that says: ‚ÄúClyde is designed to help friends hang out, with a **privacy-first and optional-only**approach.‚Äù

In addition to the AI features, they‚Äôve also announced an AI incubator for dedicating resources to developers that want to build AI on Discord.

**3/**[Anthropic‚Äôs core views on AI safety - When, why, what, and how.](https://www.anthropic.com/index/core-views-on-ai-safety)

In the batch of leading AI startups, Anthropic makes**AI safety** the forefront of its conversations the most. So when they talk about it explicitly, it‚Äôs worth reading (especially after seeing the reaction to Discord‚Äôs announcement).

In this long essay, they clarify the basis of their concerns about AI safety, how they are researching it and what‚Äôre the possible scenarios we can end up in. They are also talking about the**unintended effects**of this research (which is often dismissed when coming from critics).

\*‚ÄúWe must make every effort to avoid a scenario in which safety-motivated research accelerates the deployment of dangerous technologies.‚Äù\*Yes, we should.

\*\*(Sponsor)\*\*Top-level talent use coaching to deal with the challenges they face in their role (building trust, inspiring, gaining confidence, communicating, negotiating with investors‚Ä¶).
