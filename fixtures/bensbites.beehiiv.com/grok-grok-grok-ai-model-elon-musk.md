# Grok! Grok! Grok! - The AI model by Elon Musk

Elon‚Äôs 4-month-old company [xAI has announced its first LLM - Grok.](https://x.ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=grok-grok-grok-the-ai-model-by-elon-musk) I am 63.2% sure Elon had a competition with a chicken on who can lay eggs (LLMs) faster. Anyway, the new model will soon be available to Twitter‚Äôs Premium+ ($16/mo) subscribers.

## What‚Äôs going on here?

Elon Musk‚Äôs xAI announced their first large language model Grok.

## What does that mean?

xAI trained Grok-0 (33B) and Grok-1 models in these 4 months. The Grok-1 model will power the [consumer-facing product ‚ÄúGrok‚Äù](https://grok.x.ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=grok-grok-grok-the-ai-model-by-elon-musk). It‚Äôs essentially a GPT-3.5 competitor beating GPT-3.5, Inflection-1, and LLaMA 2 70B on different benchmarks. Grok-1 is still behind PaLM 2, Claude 2 and way behind GPT-4.

But, Grok has Elon as its hype man and he is on a streak to promote Grok on a different set of benchmarks:

- It has real-time access to information via X (Twitter).

- It‚Äôll respond with sarcasm and humour (and sometimes, swear words).

- It won‚Äôt dump you with a letter signed by ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a large language model‚Ä¶‚Äù.

Grok, the name is from a sci-fi book *Stranger in a Strange Land* and AI is inspired by *Hitchhiker‚Äôs Guide to the Galaxy*. Don‚Äôt know what means, but just letting you know.ü§∑

## Why should I care?

Okay, jokes aside. It‚Äôs the first product from the team in just 4 months. There‚Äôll definitely be room for improvement and I don‚Äôt think the team will have to worry about resources. (Elon is still the richest man on Earth). The comparison tweets are not worth looking at right now. They are either fans cherry-picking examples or angry people complaining about it.

The most impressive part of this launch is integration with X. Real-time information from not just the news websites but X user posts could end up being a key detail. And then the availability for X subscribers will take it to non-professional consumers (similar to Meta adding personas in IG).

Though you might not care, I like the naming and science fiction inspirations. (That too in a positive light for once, after all the doomer debates.)
