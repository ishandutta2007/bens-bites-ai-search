## What does this mean?

Ai Pin is Humane's vision for AI-driven consumer tech that integrates seamlessly into daily life. The screenless, standalone wearable has sensors for natural interactions and doesn't need a smartphone. It uses optical recognition, laser projection, and Qualcomm's Snapdragon platform to enable AI capabilities. The full features will be unveiled on November 9th.

## Why should I care?

This provides a first look at a new category of AI wearables for the post-smartphone era. With privacy built-in and a body-centric form, Humane aims to pioneer more personal, trust-based relationships between humans and AI. The preview highlights that the company is moving forward with shipping its first product. We may be entering the post-smartphone era of personal devices.
