Hey everyone and welcome to the 190 new folks joining us since Friday's email. You'll be happy to know the modern Indian was delish.

Another week of AI updates ahead, I wonder what we'll see this time. Let's get to what you missed over the weekend.

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

I spoke with the founder of Humanloop on Friday. It has a playground to build prompts but focuses on apps with traction, using user data to determine how good (or bad) your model is. You can automatically test various models at random with users and let data tell you what‚Äôs working. [**Check it out here**](https://humanloop.com/).

One of the best things I've read about AI recently was from Mario who's super smart and writes about tech and the future. He **[dives into a trend and how it relates to AI](https://www.generalist.com/briefing/what-to-watch-in-ai)**.

Midjourney v4 is out! And the results are pretty effing epic. Here are some examples:

Also, you can **[create your own app icons](https://twitter.com/zats/status/1589267833883873280)** pretty easily with it.

üëã Too many links?! I created a database for all links mentioned in these emails. Refer 1 friend [using this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER) and I'll send over the link database.

[StereoPose](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.01644) is a method **designed specifically for transparent objects**, using RBG instead of object point clouds.

[SEO.ai](http://SEO.ai) does‚Ä¶well, exactly what you think it does. **Like Ahrefs with AI** baked in.

[**Generate background scenery**](https://sceneryai.com/)with AI.

[**A neural network that can learn to represent human motion**](https://motionbert.github.io/). The pretraining task requires the motion encoder to recover the underlying 3D motion from noisy partial 2D observations. This pretraining helps the motion encoder learn geometric, kinematic, and physical knowledge about human motion, which can then be transferred to multiple downstream tasks.
