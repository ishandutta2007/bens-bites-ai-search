# Key statements from OpenAI at WEF Davos.

[Bloomberg interviewed Sam Altman (CEO) and Anna Makanju (VP, Global Affairs) from OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRioxTshI2E\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=key-statements-from-openai-at-wef-davos) at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Among all the hypotheticals and tangents, I found some key statements for you to catch up. Most of these are slightly paraphrased statements from Sam and a few from Anna.

- It’s good that we have a lot of anxiety regarding upcoming elections.

- AGI will be developed soon but it’ll change the world much less than we all think.

- OpenAI is working with the US military on open-source cybersecurity software and preventing veteran suicide. The recent change in Open AI’s policy that removed the words “military and warfare” was to make these use cases clear. Developing weapons and harmful tools is still prohibited. \[additional context [here](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-16/openai-working-with-us-military-on-cybersecurity-tools-for-veterans?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=key-statements-from-openai-at-wef-davos)]

- We generally don’t want publishers’ data for training \[…] Some people want to partner with us, some don’t. We’d defend the lawsuit but rather have people say no to partnerships than sue us.

- I am looking at a future where instead of artists deleting/restricting their styles in DallE, they get some economic benefit from being part of that ecosystem. We want the artist to say: “That’s awesome.”

- For the most part, people are interested in governance and regulation but I’m even more excited about governments using these systems to serve citizens.

- My view of the world is that there are two important currencies in the future “intelligence” (compute) and “energy”. Meeting the energy requirements for AI will need a breakthrough and that will also be a step in solving climate-related issues.

- I’ve not heard anything official about a partnership with Johnny (Ive). Speaking about Johnny, he has made computers very human-compatible again and again. OpenAI and the field (AI) haven’t been very good at it.
