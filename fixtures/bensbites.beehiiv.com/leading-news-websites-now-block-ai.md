## What does this mean?

Okay, so major players like The New York Times and The Guardian are part of this blockade. They're trying to control how their content feeds into AI systems. Meanwhile, right-wing sites like Breitbart aren’t bothered about blocking these bots.

Researchers are speculating this might be a tactical move to influence AI models, considering these models learn from the content they consume. Also, right-wing media isn't too involved in the copyright scuffle that's got places like The New York Times at odds with AI companies.

## Why should I care?

Here's why this matters to you: If you're into AI, tech, or just keeping up with the digital world, this is a big deal. It's about who gets to feed information into the ever-growing AI brain. This clash between media giants and AI firms could shape the future of how information is processed and presented by AI systems. We're looking at a tug-of-war over digital influence, and it's happening right now.
