## What’s Open AI cooking?

The biggest leak is **custom chatbots**—with two new tools Gizmo and Magic Create.

Gizmo packs the punch with all the create your custom chatbot features: add external knowledge files to fine-tune on, define custom actions that you chatbot can do, access browsing and coding tools, and test the chatbots in a sandbox. Gizmo will also have all the basic management features like analytics, drafts, sharing and marketplace for these chatbots. There’s less info on Magic Create, but it serves similar features by creating chatbots iteratively.

My hunch is that Gizmo will be a separate tool and Magic Create a mode in ChatGPT as some sort of V2 of custom instructions. Talking about ChatGPT, here’s what might be coming:

- Team Plan for ChatGPT - $30/month/user. $25/month for annual subscriptions. Minimum 3 members. Unlimited usage, longer context windows and privacy benefits.

- Workspace to ChatGPT - Seperate your personal and professional ChatGPT usage.

- Context Connectors: Connect your Google Drive and Microsoft Office.

- All tools - Use different modes (browsing, coding, DallE-3) in a single chat. Already rolled out to some users.

Not a leak but the community is also expecting Vision API. Again, the event is happening TODAY. And we’ll let you know all the final deets tomorrow.
