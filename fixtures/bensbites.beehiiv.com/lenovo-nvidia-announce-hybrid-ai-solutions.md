## What does this mean?

Lenovo will offer integrated systems optimized for NVIDIA's AI software and hardware. This includes the ThinkSystem server with NVIDIA GPUs and networking, and the ThinkStation workstation supporting multiple NVIDIA GPUs.

Combined with NVIDIA's NeMo framework for customizing large language models and VMware's Private AI Foundation, businesses can build, fine-tune and run generative AI tailored to their data. Lenovo's new AI services arm will also help businesses implement AI, from strategic roadmapping to scaled deployments.

## Why should I care?

This partnership enables businesses to adopt generative AI faster, with less risk and more flexibility. You can leverage Lenovo and NVIDIA's tight integration to develop custom models using your data while tapping into enterprise-grade support. Concerns around the security, stability and scalability of AI deployments are addressed. Small teams can also pilot AI thanks to consumption models like TruScale.
