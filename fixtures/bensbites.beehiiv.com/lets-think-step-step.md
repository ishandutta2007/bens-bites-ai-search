# OpenAI's roadmap

### PLUS: More research and asking if AI is really bad.

Hey folks, today we have a bunch of stuff from Open AI; they are shipping like a beast with a new method for improving the mathematical performance of LLMs, future plans of the company, and minor updates.

Then we talk a little about the AI risk and what‚Äôs going on there. For the links, there was too much good stuff today that curation took a long time. Check the [newsfeed](https://news.bensbites.co/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap) if you want more.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[**Improving Mathematical Reasoning with Process Supervision.**](https://openai.com/research/improving-mathematical-reasoning-with-process-supervision?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap)

So Open AI dropped another technical blog, and they have trained a model to achieve a new**state-of-the-art in mathematical problem-solving.** They are doing it by introducing supervision into the step-by-step process of solving complex mathematical problems.

This is big for two reasons: 1) the models get better at maths. Duh. and 2) The step-by-step process with human supervision creates hope for **solving alignment problems in LLMs.**

**[OpenAI's plans according to Sam Altman](https://website-754fwhahs-humanloopml.vercel.app/blog/open_ai_talk?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap)**

Sam Altman talked about Open AI‚Äôs plans in a talk and revealed a bunch of stuff:

- **OpenAI is heavily GPU limited at present**

- **Cheaper GPT-4** is a near-term priority. One million token context length is also possible

- **Plugins don‚Äôt have a product-market fit yet**

- A stateful API that **remembers conversation history**

Also, they have a self-serve security portal ([link](https://trust.openai.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap)) and plugins are searchable now. ([link](https://twitter.com/OfficialLoganK/status/1663986217338241025?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap))

**Dangers of AI - reading list.**

Following the AI statement yesterday, there was a long reading list of pros and cons of both sides. Replit‚Äôs founder tweeted that the **experts kinda jump from ‚Äúthis is smart‚Äù to ‚Äúexistential threat‚Äù very quickly.** I made a small reading list on this topic, collecting different views:

- Is avoiding extinction from AI really an urgent priority? ([link](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-05-31-extinction.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap))

- AI Is not an arms race. ([link](https://time.com/6283609/artificial-intelligence-race-existential-threat/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap))

- If we‚Äôre going to label AI an ‚Äòextinction risk,‚Äô we need to clarify how it could happen. ([link](https://theconversation.com/if-were-going-to-label-ai-an-extinction-risk-we-need-to-clarify-how-it-could-happen-206738?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap))

Personally, I believe that there are some clear dangers, but instead of collecting signatures, focusing on research is more important.

[Foundations & Frontiers from Contrary Capital.](https://contrary.com/foundations-and-frontiers/vision?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap)

Anna-Sofia from Contrary has been writing about **hard tech topics like climate change, chips, fusion**, and more for a while, and now it is a standalone publication. I think many of you might like it outside of the AI stuff. Check it out, [Anna](https://twitter.com/annasofialesiv?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-s-roadmap) does a great job at it.
