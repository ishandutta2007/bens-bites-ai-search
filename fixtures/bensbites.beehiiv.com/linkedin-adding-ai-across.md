## What does this mean?

The new Recruiter 2024 tool uses AI to generate better job candidate searches. AI will enhance marketing campaigns within LinkedIn under the name Accelerate. Salespeople also get access to AI-assisted searching and account research.

The LinkedIn Learning Coach is designed to give course recommendations with personalised tips. Initially focused on soft skills, LinkedIn plans to expand this functionality to other courses over time.

## Why should I care?

While AI has assisted LinkedIn behind the scenes for years, these public-facing tools can directly help you do your job better and faster. Recruiter AI may surface candidates you'd have missed, the learning coach could supplement your knowledge, marketing Accelerate could automate repetitive tasks, and sales search could find more prospects.

LinkedIn has used AI for years to suggest connections, analyze trends and provide insights. But now AI has become mainstream, thanks to tools like ChatGPT. So LinkedIn is tapping OpenAI and Microsoft AI, since Microsoft owns both LinkedIn and a stake in OpenAI.
