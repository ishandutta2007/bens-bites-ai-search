# Make songs with Copilot and Suno

[Microsoft has partnered with Suno, an AI music creation company](https://blogs.bing.com/search/december-2023/Turn-your-ideas-into-songs-with-Suno-on-Microsoft-Copilot?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=make-songs-with-copilot-and-suno), to bring their music generation capabilities to Microsoft Copilot. Anyone can create fun, personalized songs through simple text prompts, regardless of musical ability.

## What’s going on here?

Microsoft adds Suno, a music generation service, as a plugin to their Copilot.

## What does this mean?

With Suno's capabilities now available through Copilot, you can create full songs - with lyrics, instruments, and vocals - just by providing a text description of what you want, like "an upbeat pop song about adventures with my family." The AI will handle translating your idea into musical form, including matching the tone and feel of the song to cues in your prompt. No musical knowledge or ability is required on your end.

Here’s how you get it working:

- Open Microsoft Edge, visit [copilot.microsoft.com](http://copilot.microsoft.com?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=make-songs-with-copilot-and-suno) and ensure you’re signed in with your Microsoft Account

- Enable the Suno plugin or click on the Suno logo that says, “Make music with Suno”

- Ask Copilot to create a song for you such as, “Create a pop song about adventures with your family”

- Jam along to your new tune

- Share on social or with your friends and colleagues

## Why should I care?

The combination of LLM in Copilot and Suno’s music generation abilities makes putting together songs instead of parts of it. It’s principally similar to DallE-3 being added to ChatGPT. Simple prompts turned into songs with corresponding music being generated. Using LLMs to enhance prompts for multi-modal use cases is getting attention.

Another thing to notice is that till now Copilot’s vibe has been that of an assistant at work. With features like Suno, I feel Microsoft is also targeting the average Windows user in their daily life.
