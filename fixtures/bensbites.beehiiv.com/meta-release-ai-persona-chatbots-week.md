Meta’s goal is to bring the teenagers and young adults, who have flocked to TikTok, back over to Meta's apps like Instagram.

## What does this mean?

Meta is taking a big gamble on AI entertainment bots to boost usage, especially among youth. Internally codenamed "Gen AI Personas," these bots like "Bob the Robot" embody sassy personalities inspired by cartoons and celebs. The goal is to give Meta's messaging platforms their own version of viral sensations like Snapchat's My AI bot.

## Why should I care?

Meta's desperate to stay culturally relevant among fickle young audiences. They want to create experiences powered by large language models that keep users on their apps. But personality-driven bots have already caused issues for Meta and rivals (Snapchat), making inappropriate comments in early testing. While responses may seem more "human" with added personality, it risks unsafe content. Still, higher level of comfort with AI in younger audiences gives Meta hope. More chatting could mean more ads and data collection down the line.
