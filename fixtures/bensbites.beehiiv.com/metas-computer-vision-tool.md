Hey folks, yesterday I said I was making an announcement and [here it is](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1643622012156366848?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-computer-vision-tool). Quick version: I left Zapier, and I‚Äôm focusing on AI; Ben‚Äôs Bites (yay) and investing (I‚Äôve become an a16z scout).

Ben‚Äôs Bites has been a little team of 4 for a few months now: Keshav, Olly and Dani - all have been key to helping organise, write, edit, and community manage everything. Extremely grateful to them, and all your lovely thank you‚Äôs deservedly go to them.

But the biggest news is my wife and I are having twins, coming July 2023!! Truly, thank you all for your support‚Äîit encouraged me to take the leap of faith.

Right, today we‚Äôve got **OpenAI‚Äôs stance on safety**, Meta launches a state-of-the-art **computer vision tool**, **Replit** partners with **Chroma**, India **opts out of AI regulation** and creating **3D images+videos with ONE photo.**

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[OpenAI outline its approach to AI safety](https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-computer-vision-tool)

They‚Äôve remained eerily quiet during the whole\*\*‚Äúpause-AI-petition‚Äù**charade, but the guys who ultimately got the whole debate started by dominating AI development have responded.**OpenAI**have released a post outlining their**approach to AI safety**as the World moves forwards - it‚Äôs not a direct response per se, but*we all know it is really*. Front-and-centre is their defence of the ideology that AI can‚Äôt be fully aligned in the lab, use-cases can‚Äôt be foreseen, and thus**real-world experimentation**needs to be iteratively conducted. Release, release, release, slowly but surely. Also featuring strongly on their radar is the**protection of children**in their training processes (thankfully‚Ä¶), as well as swiftly addressing**data privacy\*\*concerns, even embedding them directly into the training procedure - take note Italyüòâ

[Meta AI release a state-of-the-art computer vision tool and people are excited](https://twitter.com/MetaAI/status/1643599800414380038?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-computer-vision-tool)

Are**Meta**about to edge their way back into the AI race? I don‚Äôt know a great deal about**image segmentation**and computer vision, but rumours are doing the rounds that its ‚ÄúGPT-3 moment‚Äù has officially landed, and it‚Äôs come from Meta AI‚Äôs research team. It‚Äôs called**SAM (Segment Anything Model)**, and it looks like it literally**segments any object**in any photo or video - with high edge detail too! Just check out that video on their announcement tweet! They‚Äôve even gone and fully open-sourced the dataset, 400x larger than any other ones out in the open.

According to[this guy](https://twitter.com/DrJimFan/status/1643647849824161792?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-computer-vision-tool), this is the culmination of years and years of research, and people seem to be getting damn excited. Could this be the foundational development that things like self-driving cars have been looking for?

[Vercel just keeps popping up, and here are the top startups built on it](https://twitter.com/steventey/status/1643671633499156481?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-computer-vision-tool)

AI development is literally moving at breakneck speeds these days. (And I*mean*‚Äúliterally‚Äù, I‚Äôve just pulled a muscle in mine whilst writing these damn picks - I think I‚Äôm getting old, sad times .) But anyway, with such fast development has come the need for**speedy implementations of business ideas**, and a name that‚Äôs been popping up time and again is**Vercel**. We‚Äôre frequently hyping up popular new start-ups that are frequently building on the platform, so if you don‚Äôt know then get to know! This thread goes through some of the most exciting ones: It features**Tome**- a company I love; writing assistant companies;**autopilot developer bots**; chat-with-any-pdf tools, and way more. Read the thread and check Vercel out - maybe your next big idea will be built around it‚Ä¶
