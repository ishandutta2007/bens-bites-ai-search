# Microsoft Surface and AI event in NYC - What to expect

[Microsoft is holding a “special event” in New York City on September 21st.](https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23878352/microsoft-surface-ai-event-nyc-laptop-studio-2-go-laptop-go-rumors-leaks?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=microsoft-surface-and-ai-event-in-nyc-what-to-expect) The rumours hint at\*\*three new Surface devices.\*\*Obviously, Surface devices aside,**AI updates across the board**, including Windows Copilot, Bing Chat, and Microsoft 365 are expected.

## What’s going on here?

The event will be held in person with no live streaming. We'll see Microsoft's vision for integrating AI into its products.

## What does this mean?

Three new Surface devices are expected - refreshed Laptop Studio, Go (tablet), and Laptop Go models. Leaks show more focus on software changes and lesser on the form factor. Updates to Windows copilot are also expected to be in the pipeline. More AI-powered features are already coming to Windows apps like Photos and Snipping Tool. Surface devices may also get new AI capabilities in the camera and mics.

## Why should I care?

Surface laptops and tablets launched in the event will reflect how Microsoft is looking at both software and hardware in the context of AI. They’ve previously used ARM’s NPU for offloading AI tasks in their devices, but now both Intel and AMD have those offerings. This event will showcase Microsoft's progress towards its stated goal of reinventing Windows and Surface with AI.
