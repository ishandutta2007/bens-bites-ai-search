# Microsoft's Copilot gets better looks, images, and a new model as it comes everywhere.

[Microsoft just jazzed up Bing Chat and put “Copilot” everywhere.](https://venturebeat.com/ai/microsoft-brings-ai-image-generation-to-copilot-adds-new-model-deucalion/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=microsoft-s-copilot-gets-better-looks-images-and-a-new-model-as-it-comes-everywhere) Copilot now rocks a fresh look, AI-driven image magic, and the new kid on the block, Deucalion AI model. They're also dropping a slick ad during the Super Bowl.

## What’s going on here?

Microsoft's Copilot gets better looks, images, and a new model as it comes everywhere.

## What does this mean?

The facelift for Copilot isn't just the name change. With a cleaner, image-rich interface, it's more user-friendly.

AI image creation and editing are now in the mix, powered by Designer AI (thanks to DALL-E 3 magic). English speakers in the US, UK, Australia, India, and New Zealand get first dibs on AI editing (limited free credits to test it out).

And then there's Deucalion, making Copilot's responses faster and richer, especially in Balanced mode. It's a fine-tuned model, folks from Microsoft said but they didn’t tell the base model. Likely to be GPT-4 though.

## Why should I care?

Remembers Sydney? It’s been a year since Sydney was let loose in Bing Chat. We’ve seen her get locked in an (eternal?) jail and Bing Chat evolve into Copilot.

But Copilot isn’t your boring champ, it’s Clippy reincarnated. Please don’t believe me, find dome tweets of it roasting people and avoiding work.

Just kidding. With the Super Bowl ad, Microsoft’s message is clear: It wants every common person to use Copilot. And the new fine-tuned model in the balanced model is also rad—worth testing with ChatGPT (lazyyyy) and seeing how the results compare.
