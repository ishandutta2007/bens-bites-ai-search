## What does this mean?

For the sales warriors, Copilot will prep your meeting briefs, summarise those never-ending email threads, and even nudge your CRM updates—all from Microsoft apps like Word, Outlook and OneNote.

Over in the service arena, Copilot for Service is cutting through the noise. AI-powered conversations across data sources as it comes with pre-built integrations with Salesforce, ServiceNow, and Zendesk. There’s also an option to have an embedded copilot in agent desktops for easier support and info access.

Both of these are $50 per user/month. But if you’re already on the Copilot for Microsoft 365 train, you can add on these new tools for $20 more per user/month.

## Why should I care?

A big part of sales and customer service jobs (like logging emails) are tasks that AI can do faster, and better and leave the human to do more meaningful stuff like connecting with the customers.
