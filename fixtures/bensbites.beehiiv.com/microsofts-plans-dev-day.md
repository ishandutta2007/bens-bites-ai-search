# Microsoft's Plans after Dev Day

At OpenAI’s first DevDay conference, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella made a surprise appearance during Sam Altman’s keynote. While Sam kept poking him, Satya was calm in repeating the fact that they are building the infrastructure that OpenAI needs. To which Sam replied: we have the [best partnership in tech.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-cloud/blog/2023/11/07/come-build-with-us-microsoft-and-openai-partnership-unveils-new-ai-opportunities/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=microsoft-s-plans-after-dev-day)

## What’s going on here?

## What does that mean?

The new GPT-4 Turbo offers lower pricing, longer prompts, and JSON formatting for improved efficiency. These Turbo models will be available on Azure OpenAI Service by the end of 2023. On Azure, pricing will match OpenAI's prices.

The new custom chatbots, GPTs will allow anyone to create tailored ChatGPT versions for specific tasks or audiences. Microsoft is planning a deep ecosystem support for GPTs that they’ll announce soon.

Microsoft will provide seamless integration of OpenAI and support infrastructure, meeting all enterprise needs for the new custom models program. Microsoft also gave DevDay attendees free 90-day GitHub Enterprise access.

## Why should I care?

They might seem like they are competing for enterprise attention, but both of them respect their mutual dependency to keep marching ahead in the race of AI. (even though Google is nowhere to be seen).
