# What is Mistral?

A French startup that develops fast, open-source and secure language models. Founded in 2023 by Arthur Mensch, Guillaume Lample, and Timoth√©e Lacroix.

They‚Äôve raised over $650M in funding, are valued at $2Bn, are less than a year old and have 22 employees.

<small>monthly search volume for ‚Äòmistral ai‚Äô</small>

The company is important for a few reasons;

- It‚Äôs*actually*open-source, you know like OpenAI was supposed to be? Or how LlaMA by Meta kinda is but isn‚Äôt?

- It‚Äôs developed 2 AI models in less than a year.

- It‚Äôs French.

The founders are 3 researchers from DeepMind and Meta who aimed to beat GPT 3.5 by year-end. And they did.

They started a new company, Mistral AI, in May 2023 and had the biggest seed round in the EU within 4 weeks.

# Who‚Äôs behind it?

Mistral‚Äôs CEO Arthur Mensch was at Deepmind for a little less than 3 years where he worked on research around the retrieval-based models, sparse mixture of experts and then co-authored the famous Chinchilla paper on the scaling laws of LLMs.

So he‚Äôs legit.

CTO Timoth√©e Lacroix and Chief Scientist Guillaume Lample were at Meta. They both have nearly a decade of experience in research. And, they had just been part of the team behind Meta‚Äôs own LLM, LLaMA in February.

Also legit.

# A peek inside their seed decküëÄ

Their seed deck has been floating around the internet. Which you can view[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gquqRqiT-2Be85p_5w0izGQGgHvVzncQ/view?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=how-mistral-ai-an-openai-competitor-rocketed-to-2bn-in-12-months).

And there are a few things to mention specifically.

They believe the most value is in the hard-to-make tech e.g. the models themselves. Trained on powerful machines, trillions of words, high-quality sources‚Äîwhich is one barrier to entry.

The other barrier? A talented (and capable) team.

There were a few others on the team at the time of the first raise:

- [Jean-Charles Samuelian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jcsamuelian/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=how-mistral-ai-an-openai-competitor-rocketed-to-2bn-in-12-months)- CEO of[Alan](https://alan.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=how-mistral-ai-an-openai-competitor-rocketed-to-2bn-in-12-months)(looks like he is a Co-Founding advisor & Board Member at Mistral)

- [Charles Gorintin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/charles-gorintin/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=how-mistral-ai-an-openai-competitor-rocketed-to-2bn-in-12-months)- CTO of[Alan](https://alan.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=how-mistral-ai-an-openai-competitor-rocketed-to-2bn-in-12-months)(also Co-Founding Advisor at Mistral)

- [C√©dric O](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cedric-o/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=how-mistral-ai-an-openai-competitor-rocketed-to-2bn-in-12-months)- Former French Secretary of State for Digital Affairs (also Co-Founding Advisor at Mistral)

Continuing through their deck‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAll major actors are US-based‚Äù.

The Mistral team wanted to cement itself as the European leader.

**Closed-source vs open-source**. The big debate.

Mistral believes (as do many others, myself included) that there are several concerns with closed AI approaches; businesses have to send sensitive data to it, only exposing the outputs doesn‚Äôt help connect with other components (retrieval, structure inputs etc) and the data used to train the models are secret (so we assume it can do some things it perhaps hasn‚Äôt been trained on).

Now the bold stuff.

‚ÄúMistral will offer the best technology in 4 years‚Äù.

How?

- They‚Äôll take a more open approach to model development.

- Tighter integration with customers‚Äô workflows.

- Increase focus on data sources and control.

- Propose unmatched guarantees on security and privacy.

There‚Äôs a lot more detail in their[deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gquqRqiT-2Be85p_5w0izGQGgHvVzncQ/view?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=how-mistral-ai-an-openai-competitor-rocketed-to-2bn-in-12-months)on the above 4 points.

As far as business focus goes‚Ä¶

‚ÄúOn the business side, we will provide the most valuable technology brick to the emerging AI-as-a-service industry that will revolutionise business workflows with generative AI. We will co-build integrated solutions with European integrators and industry clients, and get extremely valuable feedback from this to become the main tool for all companies wanting to leverage AI in Europe.‚Äù

# Roadmap analysis

Let‚Äôs look at their roadmap (remember this was from pre-June) and see what they planned on doing compared to what has happened.
