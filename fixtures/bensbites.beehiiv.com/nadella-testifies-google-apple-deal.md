# Nadella testifies against Google and Apple deal

[Satya Nadella, Microsoft's CEO, testified in an antitrust trial against Google](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsoft-ceo-testifies-about-limits-of-ai-at-google-antitrust-trial-32d032a9?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=nadella-testifies-against-google-and-apple-deal) about anti-competitive search practices. Nadella thinks it will take more than AI to check Googleâ€™s advantage in internet search.

## What's going on here?

Nadella argued Google uses distribution deals and dominance to trap Microsoft's Bing in an unwinnable "vicious cycle."

## What does this mean?

Google's search defaults on Apple products like Safari reinforce user habits that maintain its 90% market share. This lets Google continually improve its product while disadvantaging Microsoft. Nadella called switching search engines practically impossible given Google's entrenched position.

Nadella was skeptical new AI could disrupt this cycle. He worries defaults will still favor Google, even if tools like ChatGPT create new search angles. Earlier optimism about transforming search with AI was possibly "exuberance" from leading a small player.

## Why should I care?

The trial reveals how tech giants leverage dominance. Google's agreements locked in market share gains from a better search product. This insight matters if you believe search needs more competition or that Google unfairly restricts rivals. Understanding the "no fly zone" Google created around search helps explain the industry's dynamics.
