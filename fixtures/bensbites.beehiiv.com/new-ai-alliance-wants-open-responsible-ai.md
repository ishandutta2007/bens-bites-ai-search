# The new AI alliance wants open and responsible AI

There’s a [new collaboration group on AI safety and progress.](https://newsroom.ibm.com/AI-Alliance-Launches-as-an-International-Community-of-Leading-Technology-Developers,-Researchers,-and-Adopters-Collaborating-Together-to-Advance-Open,-Safe,-Responsible-AI?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=the-new-ai-alliance-wants-open-and-responsible-ai) The [AI Alliance](https://thealliance.ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=the-new-ai-alliance-wants-open-and-responsible-ai) from IBM and Meta is bringing together leading developers, researchers, academics, companies and innovators to collaborate on projects supporting trustworthy and inclusive AI systems.

## What's going on here?

IBM and Meta have launched an international AI Alliance along with over 50 other organizations to advance open and responsible AI innovation.

## What does this mean?

There are 50 initial members with universities, organizations and companies. Apart from AI companies like Hugging Face and Stability AI, the Alliance also includes Dell, Sony and CERN.

By pooling knowledge and resources, Alliance members will try to create benchmarks and tools for safe and ethical AI development. So that rather than addressing risks later, members can proactively tackle challenges around bias, security and more. The Alliance believes it’ll allow faster innovation of AI systems that work with the complexity of global societies.

## Why should I care?

Most of the institutions and companies in this Alliance are pro-open source. The Alliance will set up guidelines, a board and a technical oversight committee for different areas of progress.

To be critical, it feels like these sorts of groups are coming up every month now. But with a million plus staff members, 400k+ students and $80B+ in R\&D funds, the AI alliance seems like a group that wants progress, has enough skin in the game and has the power to build. Let’s see how this one works.
