**1/**

[Zoom hit the AI scene with the ultimate video companion](https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-iq-smart-companion/)

**Zoom**is finally zooooming into the AI space, and I‚Äôm looking forward to a bit of levelling up to helping me disassociate their name from COVID.**Zoom IQ**is going to become a super smart**video chat companion**that empowers blaaah blah, let‚Äôs just get into it. If you turn up late to a meeting, you‚Äôll be able to quickly have a**meeting summary generated**so that you can get stuck in; chat threads will be summarised if you had to pop off and miss a loada messages. And then there‚Äôll be bits of post-meeting idea organisation, drafting chat content, and creating whiteboard sessions (whatever they are!). Zoom is back, baby!

**2/**

[Introducing randomness to chatbot AI will make it more like a human](https://stream.thesephist.com/updates/1679928334)

If I told you there‚Äôs a strong case for why chatbot**AI should be more random**, you‚Äôd probably be pretty sceptical. (Well I was anyway, but maybe you‚Äôre smarter than me.) Linked above is a really awesome blog post on*The Stream*that makes just this argument‚Ä¶ Part of the**quality of human conversation**and collaboration and idea generation comes in the**inherent randomness in our thoughts**, triggering changes in conversation path and subsequent creativity. The problem is that chatbots are great at solving problems, but are ‚Äúoverly obedient and**hopelessly unimaginative**‚Äù. We should*introduce randomness*by training on*real human conversion*. This guy has and he reckons it works a treat‚Ä¶

**3/**

[Luma AI releases a NeRF-based API for Video-to-3D technology](https://twitter.com/lumalabsai/status/1640369332005003265)

I goddamn love**NeRF tech**. All those photorealistic 3D objects really let you feel like you‚Äôre in a place that you‚Äôre not, and I‚Äôm very much here for it.**Luma AI**just brought us a step closer to ‚Äúinternet scale 3D‚Äù with their**Video-to-3D API**- yep, API. Developers will have access to NeRF modelling at the accessibly cheap price of $1 per scene, where you‚Äôll be able to input a video and get fully stuck into**interactive 3D scenes**. (And yes, I know ‚Äúaccessibly‚Äù isn‚Äôt a word but it feels right.)

**4/**

[Attention is](https://www.notboring.co/p/attention-is-all-you-need)**[all you need](https://www.notboring.co/p/attention-is-all-you-need)**[from Not Boring](https://www.notboring.co/p/attention-is-all-you-need)

Packy doesn‚Äôt miss. Another excellent read from him on OpenAI ‚Äòstumbling‚Äô from a research team to potentially unlocking the **most profitable business model** out there. He discusses the **Apex Aggregator** and a world (in the not-too-distant future) where our behaviours as consumers could rapidly change, and what that could mean for APIs and companies we (and other businesses) rely on. It‚Äôs a long, but fascinating read. Highly recommend.
