We're back from our 4-day long email break. Which means I missed a ton and a bunch of it made it to today's email. But relax, it's not 'real work'. It's just an email, I'll have more stuff tomorrow and the next day. Take your pick at what's interesting, like circling that leftover platter for the 5th time!!

*For those that don't know I work at Zapier. I'm going to be working on some exciting AI ü§ù Zapier projects in the new year and am looking for folks who want to get early access to Zapier products, push the boundaries of Zapier and AI, give feedback and create cool demos of what's possible. If it sounds interesting to you, click [here](https://ai.zapier.app/).*

Let's get to it.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

**Large Language Models Encode Clinical Knowledge**. So, basically, large language models (LLMs) are really good at understanding and generating human language. However, using them in the medical and clinical fields is a bit more complicated because mistakes in these areas can have serious consequences. To make sure LLMs are up to snuff in these fields, the authors of this research created a new benchmark called MultiMedQA, which tests how well LLMs can answer medical questions, and a new dataset called HealthSearchQA with medical questions that people have searched for online. They also developed a framework for evaluating LLMs and tested two different models. Flan-PaLM did pretty well, but the authors introduced a new method called instruction prompt tuning to improve its performance even further. The resulting model, Med-PaLM, did better, but still wasn't quite as good as human clinicians. Overall, the research suggests that LLMs have the potential to be useful in the medical and clinical fields, but there's still more work to be done to make them reliable.([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13138))

Email Triager - An email assistant that **automatically drafts email replies** behind the scenes. Now all those emails can be answered to get us to the haloed Inbox Zero! All you gotta do is hire a VA to click send on each email, jk. ([link](https://www.emailtriager.com/))

**This Detroit startup aims to shape the future of video creation with AI (Sponsor).**\
Small Michigan startup Waymark is trying to break down barriers to video creation with the help of AI. With Waymark, users just type in basic information, and a team of AI models generates a complete marketing video for them in minutes. It looks like this approach is already picking up steam - Waymark has a few enterprise clients under its belt and has been listed in both Hulu and Roku's creative directories.\
