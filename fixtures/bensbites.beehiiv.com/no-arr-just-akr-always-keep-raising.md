Hey folks, this is Ben‚Äôs Bites. More funds coming down the pipeline for Anthropic! We have an update about an ML competition platform, Nat Friedman‚Äôs new tool and some behind-the-scenes to inspire you to keep tinkering.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

**1/** **[OpenAI rival Anthropic raises funding at a $4.1 billion valuation.](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-rival-anthropic-raises-funding-at-4-1-billion-valuation)**

Early in February, Google announced it was investing $300M in Antropic, another AI startup that created a ChatGPT competitor called Claude. Just one month later, Anthropic is raising another\*\*$300M from Spark Capital.\*\*

According to Crunchbase, that puts their current valuation at $4.1B and the amount of money raised totalling $1.3B, all while having\*\*no significant revenue.\*\*Although these numbers are significantly less than Microsoft‚Äôs investment in Open AI, let‚Äôs see how this goes when Anthropic starts pushing for revenue.

**2/** **[Kaggle announces Kaggle Models on their platform.](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback/391200)**

Kaggle will make integrating pre-trained models in their projects**easier for participants** in competitions hosted on Kaggle. Before this, many of them used Kaggle's dataset features to use pre-trained models.

They are starting with about 2000 public models from TensorFlow hub. If you want a shorter version of the full announcement, check out this [thread](https://twitter.com/kaggle/status/1630991704781193221) from them.

**3/** **[Nat Friedman (ex-GitHub CEO) launched a multi-model playground](https://nat.dev/)**

Nat Friedman not only ran GitHub but he invests in AI companies through AI Grant, alongside Daniel Gross. Nat built a (familiar-looking) **AI prompt playground**, but the kicker is being able to **compare the output of basically any LLM** out there. I highly recommend cancelling those boring Zoom meetings and just playing around with it.

**4/\*\*\*\*[Inventing and coding a puzzle with ChatGPT](https://sumplete.com/about/)**

Sumplete is a **unique puzzle game** where you remove numbers from a grid to make the sum of rows and columns equal to some random values.

Daniel Tait created this game, and you all loved it in Monday‚Äôs edition of Ben‚Äôs Bites. He has added an about page going through his process of finding the right idea, coding the game, and finally naming it‚Äî**all using ChatGPT.**

If you‚Äôre the person who makes your own rules in board games, you can now make them official in your own game. Hit reply and let me know your unique game ideas.

‚Äú**[Hey Zo√´](https://www.loom.com/share/d0db1ef81c034ab28e8b9761ab6ffafd)** **(Sponsor)**, show me subscription revenue by marketing channel, in the state that Lebron James was born, in the quarter that apple released iOS update 14.5.‚Äù

When **everyone on your team can ask questions** and get the answers they need to do their job, better things will happen for your brand.

Zenlytic combines the power of Open AI‚Äôs GPT-3 with the accuracy of their own proprietary data model to **empower humans with data.**
