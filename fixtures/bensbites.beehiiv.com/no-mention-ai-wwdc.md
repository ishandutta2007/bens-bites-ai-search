[Apple steal the AI limelight with their new VR headset](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/05/apple-vr-headset-wwdc-stock/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=no-mention-of-ai-in-wwdc)

I know it‚Äôs**not technically AI,**that it feels about 2 years too late, is prohibitively expensive, and apparently looks like ski goggles, but**Apple‚Äôs new headset**is the talk of the town right now and we like to talk and towns. Users can**access apps, watch movies, and write documents**in a virtual world. And let‚Äôs face it, Apple are probably the ones to give it the best punt on the hardware front, so let‚Äôs give them their chance.

In all, Apple didn‚Äôt mention AI in their WWDC event but under the hood, there is\*\*some AI stuff happening.\*\*For example, the new autocorrect that will learn your frequently used words (including swears) is based on the transformer model. The notable highlight is that they are focusing on running their ‚Äúmachine learning models‚Äù on their devices instead of the cloud.

[OpenAI‚Äôs very own guide to effectively using GPT](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt-best-practices?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=no-mention-of-ai-in-wwdc)

Man, OpenAI is damn sharp. I dunno if you‚Äôve noticed, but Twitter has been pretty jam-packed lately with folks claiming that the quality of ChatGPT outputs has been strangely slipping over the past few weeks. And only a few days later out comes a**guide on prompting**from yours truly (OpenAI). ‚ÄúYeah, it‚Äôs not us, it‚Äôs you‚Äù is the message I‚Äôm getting here‚Ä¶ The advice is to**write clear instructions, split your request into subtasks, provide a chain of reasoning**to help the chatbot, and more.

[OpenML‚Äôs top-rated language model comes to Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/blog/falcon?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=no-mention-of-ai-in-wwdc)

This is one for you AI and ML devs out there. There‚Äôs been a model straight outta the Middle East that‚Äôs been garnering some attention over the past month or so, and it‚Äôs just landed at Hugging Face. The Abu Dhabi Tech Innovation Institute‚Äôs model has**topped the OpenLM leaderboard**for a while now and is fully**open-sourced on the Apache 2.0 licence**. It has the**40B model**at the top and a**7B**sibling that also tops its weight class.
