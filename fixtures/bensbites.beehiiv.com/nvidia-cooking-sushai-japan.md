## What does this mean?

Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang stated Japan has no need to export its data or AI, implying it has the technical expertise and industrial capability to nurture a self-sufficient AI ecosystem. Huang also met with the Japanese Prime Minister and said that he has promised the PM to prioritise Japan’s request for GPUs.

## Why should I care?

We are going to see this more: countries wanting to get AI companies to work with them (especially the hardware makers). And at the same time, companies going outside just the US/EU to find more flexible business terms (like China-related regulations).
