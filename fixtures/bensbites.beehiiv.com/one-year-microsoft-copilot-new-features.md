# One year of Microsoft Copilot and new features

Just like ChatGPT, [Microsoft’s Copilot has also completed its year one](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/12/05/celebrating-the-first-year-of-copilot-with-significant-new-innovations/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=one-year-of-microsoft-copilot-and-new-features) and Microsoft’s celebrating. And it is promising some of the other AI features coming into Copilot—some old and some new.

## What's going on here?

Microsoft Copilot is going to get some “new” AI features in its second year.

## What does this mean?

To start with, Copliot will also be using the new model from OpenAI—GPT-4 Turbo and an updated version of DALL-E3. Then Code interpreter will slowly to Copilot (fka Bing chat)—at first just using code to answer queries and then with the ability to add your own files, just like ChatGPT plus. Similarly, Microsoft is combining GPT-4V with its web image and search data to make Copilot multimodal.

There are two “new” product-specific features as well (not taken from ChatGPT) —Inline Compose and Deep Search. Inline compose can get Copilot to rewrite text on any website (unclear what this means) and Deep Search can refine queries with extra information and specific requests (like in Perplexity).

## Why should I care?

If I’m being honest, GPT-4 Turbo is not the most impressive addition when everyone is complaining that it’s worse. But what makes me (and [Ethan](https://x.com/emollick/status/1732096645678895476?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=one-year-of-microsoft-copilot-and-new-features)) excited is that soon many capabilities of ChatGPT Plus will be free in 169 countries. Especially when ChatGPT plus subscriptions are paused.

Another interesting point is that Copilot is evolving beyond the chatbox and adding more product-specific features in Edge and Search. These, IMO, have the power to take users away from Google products.
