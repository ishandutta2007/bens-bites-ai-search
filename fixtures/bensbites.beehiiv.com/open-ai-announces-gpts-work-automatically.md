# Open AI announces GPTs to do your work automatically.

[Open AI has released its first version of AI agents.](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-gpts?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-announces-gpts-to-do-your-work-automatically) They are called GPTs. GPTs are custom chatbots within ChatGPT that you can create without knowing how to code. GPTs can focus on individual tasks with all the knowledge and tools of ChatGPT behind them.

## What’s going on here?

Open AI released custom chatbots called GPTs at its Dev Day.

## What does that mean?

You can create GPTs just by prompting the GPT builder. It’ll set up the custom instructions automatically. It’ll name your bot, create a profile picture for it and even suggest default questions to display for the user.

Next up, you can configure your GPT to use code interpreter (yes they renamed it back), web browsing or DallE-3. You can also add external documents to give your GPTs additional knowledge/context. It’ll automatically do the retrieval, with no need for technical set-up (eg: embeddings, chunking or search algos).

You can then preview your GPT before making it live: for yourself, your team, or everyone in the GPT store. The GPT store will come live soon and it’ll have revenue sharing for top creators.

Open AI also released the same powers for developers via its Assistant API (and more). Check the full [Open AI Dev Day summary.](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/updates-open-ai-dev-day)

## Why should I care?

In the long term, Open AI's vision is to evolve GPTs into fully autonomous agents. But right now, think of them as Plugins made accessible. If you had a prompt, or a workflow you were using repeatedly within chatGPT but didn’t know how to turn it into a plugin, you can do that with GPTs now (again, no coding and much better performance).

And when GPTs take over, I’ll also just GPT - Go Play Tennis.
