The drama at OpenAI seems to have come to a halt for now. Sam is returning as CEO. The OAI team got back to shipping even before the news broke.

## Nice, I want details‚Ä¶

The OpenAI X account posted that they have reached an [agreement in principle](https://twitter.com/openai/status/1727205556136579362?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-is-back-in-action-after-a-coup-attempt). Sam will return to OpenAI as CEO with a new initial board of Bret Taylor (Chair), Larry Summers, and Adam D'Angelo.

Taylor is ex-CEO of Salesforce and one of the most senior/sought-after folks on tech company boards. Summers is the former US Secretary of the Treasury.

[Bloomberg reported](https://twitter.com/emilychangtv/status/1727216818648134101?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-is-back-in-action-after-a-coup-attempt) that the final discussions on who‚Äôll be on the board were sticky. OpenAI's initial board will vet and appoint a new formal board of up to 9 people; Microsoft and Sam Altman will likely have a seat on the formal board ([The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/22/23967223/sam-altman-returns-ceo-open-ai?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-is-back-in-action-after-a-coup-attempt))

## What about the rest of the people?

Emmett is now the Interim ex-CEO of Open AI as per his X bio. He‚Äôs glad to have played a part in the solution.

Though Helen Toner (one of the *coup\** members) posted ‚ÄúAnd now, we all get some sleep‚Äù retweeting the OpenAI announcement, the[NYT reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/21/technology/openai-altman-board-fight.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-is-back-in-action-after-a-coup-attempt) that a paper co-written by her in October was a major part of the disagreements.

## There‚Äôs still one big question: why did all this happen?

And the board will investigate this internally, to which [Sam has agreed](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/breaking-sam-altman-to-return-as-openai-ceo?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-is-back-in-action-after-a-coup-attempt). A few hours before the ‚ÄúAll is well‚Äù news came, a bunch of former employees of OpenAI shared a letter to the board to [expand the scope of the investigation](https://twitter.com/pitdesi/status/1727106366534492562?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-is-back-in-action-after-a-coup-attempt) with their allegation of Sam‚Äôs (and the exec team‚Äôs) actions during the 2019 transition from non-profit to for-profit.
