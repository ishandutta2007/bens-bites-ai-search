Also, it states training ChatGPT with books is transformative fair use, not direct infringement, as the**purpose is to teach models rules of language**, not profit directly from pirated works.

For example, your email and name from a public blog post. This doesn’t change how Meta trains its AI on your comments and posts on FB/Insta, etc.
