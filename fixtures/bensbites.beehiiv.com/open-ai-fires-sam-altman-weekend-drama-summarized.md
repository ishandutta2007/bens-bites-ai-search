# Open AI fires Sam Altman - The weekend drama summarized.

OpenAI fired its CEO Sam Altman on Friday. Since then, combined seasons of Succession and Silicon Valley have happened leading up to Sam Altman, Greg Brockman and other top researchers from Open AI joining Microsoft and Emmett Shear (co-founder of Twitch) as the Interim CEO of Open AI.

We’ve got a quick overview of **the timeline,** what really went down, and *the rumours/opinions*of the weekend.If you’re already caught up, you can follow [real-time updates from Monday morning here.](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/whats-going-open-ai)

# Open AI board fires Sam Altman

**Friday noon, 17th Nov 2023: OpenAI releases a blog post announcing**[**changes in OpenAI’s leadership.**](https://openai.com/blog/openai-announces-leadership-transition?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized)

Open AI has a [weird company structure](https://chamath.substack.com/p/a-short-history-of-openai?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized). In short, a non-profit board has all the decision-making powers and their duty doesn’t lie with shareholders, but with the creation of AGI that’s safe for all of humanity.

In the blog post, this board:

1. Fires Sam Altman from the company. The board says that Sam has not been candid in his communications with the board. The board no longer has confidence in his ability to continue leading OpenAI.

2. Removes Greg Brockman from his position as Chairman of the board (not the Company).

3. Announces CTO Mira Murati to be Interim CEO.

Following this, [Sam tweets his exit](https://x.com/sama/status/1725631621511184771?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized).

*The speculations about what Sam might have done ranged from a security breach, being too fast and profit-driven, and achieving/pushing for AGI with others in the dark. People dig into Sam Altman’s personal and*[*professional history.*](https://x.com/EricNewcomer/status/1725633569056506282?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized)

**Friday noon, 17th Nov 2023: Satya Nadella responds.**

A key line from his tweet:

“We have a long-term agreement with OpenAI with full access to everything we need to deliver on our innovation agenda and an exciting product roadmap; and remain committed to our partnership, and to Mira and the team.”

*Journalists report that*[*Microsoft*](https://www.axios.com/2023/11/17/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-ouster?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized)*and*[*other investors*](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/11/17/openai-investors-blindsided-by-sam-altmans-firing/?sh=69233bc83fc9\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized)*got to know about the decision only a minute before it was made public.*

# Greg exits with Sam, and old friends join them

**Friday night, 17th Nov 2023: A couple of hours after, Greg Brockman quits Open AI.**[**Greg Brockman shares Sam and his POV.**](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1725736242137182594?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized)**Still, no clear reasons.**

<small>lowercase resignation by gdb</small>

- Last night (16th Nov), Sam got a text from Ilya asking to talk at noon on Friday. Sam joined a Google Meet and the whole board, except Greg, was there. Ilya told Sam he was being fired and that the news was going out very soon.

- At 12:19 pm (17th Nov), Greg got a text from Ilya asking for a quick call. At 12:23 pm, Ilya sent a Google Meet link. Greg was told that he was being removed from the board (but was vital to the company and would retain his role) and that Sam had been fired. Around the same time, OpenAI published a blog post.

- As far as they know, the management team was made aware of this shortly after, other than Mira who found out the night prior.

Sam reposts this, shares his feelings and [jokes(?) about going off.](https://x.com/sama/status/1725748751367852439?s=20\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized)

# People want Sam back in charge

“We can say definitively that the board's decision was not made in response to malfeasance or anything related to our financial, business, safety, or security/privacy practices. This was a breakdown in communication between Sam and the board.”

Throughout the day, Microsoft, other Investors and (not yet public) staff willing to leave pressured the board to resign and bring Sam back as CEO. People at OpenAI are [optimistic](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-optimistic-it-can-bring-back-sam-altman-greg-brockman?rc=bdorru\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-fires-sam-altman-the-weekend-drama-summarized) that Sam will be back. The board agreed in principle but missed the 5 PM deadline to execute on it.

X feeds are filled with OpenAI employees including execs and heads of departments reposting Sam’s tweet with heart emojis. COO Brad Lightcap, CSO Jason Kwon and CTO Mira Murati are among them.
