Hello folks, here’s what we have today;

##### <mark>**Our picks**</mark>

**1/**

We reported last week that**ChatGPT**would soon be coming to you**Android**users, and[it’s officially here](https://twitter.com/openai/status/1683854695398522881). And a pretty eclectic array of countries are able to get involved: US, Bangladesh, Brazil, and India. Get stuck in!

**2/**

Remember the**AI Classifier**that**OpenAI**released to help people**detect when something is written by AI**? Well[they’ve just taken it offline following consistent reports of poor accuracy](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/openai-scuttles-ai-written-text-detector-over-low-rate-of-accuracy/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-shuts-down-its-ai-detector)rates. This is a good thing - poor-performing AI detectors can easily hamper students and job applicants when blindly used by people in charge.

**3/**

**Spotify**is known for having some fire AI/ML devs, and now the[CEO is giving us our first tease](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/25/spotify-ceo-teases-potential-upcoming-ai-powered-capabilities-surrounding-personalization-and-ads/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-shuts-down-its-ai-detector)since their AI DJ earlier this year. He’s said they could begin using AI to create**ultra-personalised experiences**, summarise podcasts, and even help out those pesky advertisers. One more thing: they’re in the process of patenting a text-to-speech model - audiobook generation on the horizon too?

[The first room-temperature ambient pressure superconductor.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12008?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-shuts-down-its-ai-detector)These folks have created a superconductor that retains its\*\*superconductivity at room temperature.\*\*For context: superconductors today usually work at very low temperatures, less than -150°C.

This isn’t AI, but if true this is\*\*another tech that can have exponential impact.\*\*Here’s a[thread on possible applications.](https://twitter.com/alexkaplan0/status/1684044616528453633?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-ai-shuts-down-its-ai-detector)
