NOTE: Sorry, this is a re-send of today‚Äôs email. Had some trouble testing out our custom domain. It broke. So re-sending from our trusty usual email. Sorry about that!

Hello folks and welcome to 9966 of you who joined last week. Today we have some open-source alternatives making their case and players like Grammarly and General Motors announcing their next moves.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[Thanks to LLaMA, language models are more open than ever before](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Mar/11/llama/)

OK, so we all had a bit of a go at**Meta**for saying that their**LLaMA model**was more open than it actually is, but maybe we‚Äôre about to eat our words‚Ä¶ This article has convinced me that the presence of LLaMA is about to kickstart the generative art moment for chatbots. And it‚Äôs only taken a small push. Thanks to a combination of LLaMA model leaks and[some legend](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)compressing the models into a manageable size for personal computers, chatbot development is now**accessible to everyone**with a laptop.

Whilst this means that the tech is available to spammers, scammers, indoctrinators, and all-around bad actors, it also means that we‚Äôre entering a stage of**truly open-source**chatbot modelling. Is the AI world about to change again, accelerating at a pace not seen before?

Check out[this post](https://til.simonwillison.net/llms/llama-7b-m2)for how to run these models on your Mac.

[Together release OpenChatKit, their open-source version of ChatGPT](https://twitter.com/ItakGol/status/1634590622286741504)

Talking of open-sourcing language models, there‚Äôs another band of ex-OpenAI employees on the loose, and it‚Äôs not the Anthropic team.**Together**(that‚Äôs the name of the company) has released[OpenChatKit](https://www.together.xyz/blog/openchatkit)- their**alternative to ChatGPT**. With model weights, model code, and training data fully available, this is truly open. I have no idea how, but somehow it‚Äôs been trained with 100%**negative carbon compute**; it‚Äôs got customisation recipes for fine-tuning to get yourself an expert chatbot; and it has a top-notch retrieval system to apply live-updating data to your models.

**3/**

[Grammarly enter the generative AI space with GrammarlyGO](https://9to5google.com/2023/03/09/grammarly-ai-generative/)

As if**Grammarly**didn‚Äôt have enough presence interrupting YouTube videos and appearing between Insta reels, they‚Äôre about to get a whole load more attention as they step into the AI space (at least from us anyway). Enter[GrammarlyGO](https://www.grammarly.com/grammarlygo). Using generative AI, they‚Äôll be able to compose text in your own writing style, reply to emails, rewrite for tone and clarity, adjust the length of your text, and provide a prompt-space for guidance. This really is a big gun wading into the productivity space!

**4/**

[General Motors want to bring ChatGPT-style assistants to your car](https://www.semafor.com/article/03/10/2023/gm-wants-to-bring-chatgpt-like-assistant-to-drivers)

So that we don‚Äôt all get bored during the life-long wait for driverless cars, it looks like we might get something to wet our whistles with on the way there. According to Semafor,**General Motors**wants to bring**chatbot-style assistants to your cars**. They could potentially do things like telling you how to change a tire when it goes flat in the middle of a desert, or whether or not you‚Äôll be able to make it to your destination when your tank is running low. With the need for absolute perfection with cars, this isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm gonna get too excited about just yet, but still pretty damn cool.

\*\*(Sponsor)\*\*Do you ever see amazing AI-generated images and wonder, how did they make that?

The folks at **PromptHero** have made an**in-depth course** perfect for curious minds that want to get from zero to expert in AI image generation. **No previous experience required**‚Äì they walk you through from scratch, step by step.
