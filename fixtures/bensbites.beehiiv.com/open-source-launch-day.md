Hello folks, here’s what we have today;

p.s. I jumped the gun on[Superhuman AI](http://superhuman.com/?utm_source=bensbites), they delayed their launch to actually be today, my bad :)

**[Llama 2 is free to download for research and commercial use.](https://ai.meta.com/llama/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-source-launch-day)**

Meta has outdone itself in their launch of Llama 2, the next edition of its open-source models. It has 3 sizes with 7B, 13B, and 70B parameters and is**trained on 2T tokens.**

[The technical paper](https://scontent.fixc1-4.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t39.2365-6/10000000_663429262362723_1696968207443577320_n.pdf?_nc_cat=101\&ccb=1-7&_nc_sid=3c67a6&_nc_ohc=5ol-jUSglG4AX-yrHMu&_nc_ht=scontent.fixc1-4.fna\&oh=00_AfAQg5zlPWkffhQDZSvQ5OSGrr2tUIqbtU3lZBHMWP6Ufg\&oe=64BBB691)includes details about pre-training, red teaming, and other methodologies used by them. They’ve also got[plenty of support](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2-statement-of-support/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-source-launch-day)from the likes of a16z, Intel, YC, etc. for this open approach. And…a bunch of**Azure servers from Microsoft.**

[**Scale AI is releasing its Scale LLM Engine**](https://scale.com/custom-llms?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-source-launch-day)to fine-tune open-source models.

Timing it with the Llama 2 launch, Scale has open-sourced this with multiple**resources on finetuning Llama 2**in[this thread.](https://twitter.com/alexandr_wang/status/1681370162656681984?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-source-launch-day)There’s also an offering for enterprise customers who want to use Scale’s Data Engine to build customs LLMs.

[**Langchain launches LangSmith - A unified platform production ready LLM applications.**](https://blog.langchain.dev/announcing-langsmith/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-source-launch-day)

Langchain is joining this unofficial launch day with a new platform LangSmith. Langsmith will allow devs to**debug, test, evaluate, and monitor their LLM applications**in one place so that they can be deployed beyond just a Twitter demo.

\*\*[Langsmith is in beta now.](https://www.langchain.com/langsmith?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=open-source-launch-day)\*\*It’s wild to see Langchain go from a GitHub project to big tech like landing pages. AI is awesome.
