## What does this mean?

Some context: Common Sense Media is a nonprofit creating advisory content for parents and kids to navigate the digital media landscape.

OpenAI and Common Sense Media are rolling out guidelines and educational stuff for the folks at home and in schools, ensuring everyone's up to speed on using AI without any hiccups. Plus, they're curating a section in the GPT Store that's all about family-friendly content, vetted by Common Sense's own standards.

Talking about this at the Common Sense Media summit, Sam Altman (CEO, of OpenAI) thinks that the idea that AI is bad for kids is flawed. There are risks, and OpenAI is anxious about them but to not teach them these tools is a bigger mistake. And about kids getting lazy? Altman has said in past: We adapted to calculators and changed what we tested for in math class.

## Why should I care?

Common Sense Media has an AI section already with guidelines and ratings for top AI providers. But this partnership goes beyond putting up a stamp: “Hey, this is risky, don’t use it”. Both OpenAI and Common Sense Media are trying to create resources that families, schools and teens can actually use. And I guess that’s a step in the right direction.
