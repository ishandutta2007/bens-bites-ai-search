# OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips.

[Open AI is exploring making its own AI chips](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips) to solve its shortage of expensive AI chips that power its software and products. The company relies heavily on Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) and Microsoftâ€™s partnership to access them.

## What does this mean?

Open AI sees in-house chip development as key to tackling two big problems: the global scarcity of high-end AI chips and the massive computing costs of running systems like ChatGPT. CEO Sam Altman has made acquiring more AI chips a top priority given Open AI's reliance on Nvidia, which controls over 80% of the AI chip market.

## Why should I care?

Custom AI chips could significantly reduce Open AI's hardware costs and chip shortage issues, allowing it to scale its AI technologies more easily. However, building custom AI chips is a complex and expensive endeavour that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars with no guarantee of success. Even if Open AI acquires a chip company, it would still take years to develop its own chips.
