# OpenAI kills Chat with PDF apps. Or did it?

Some people are getting [updates to GPT-4](https://twitter.com/ldjconfirmed/status/1718456393026490523?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=openai-kills-chat-with-pdf-apps-or-did-it) where you can use, Vision, ADA (code interpreter), Browsing and DallE-3 in the same chat. It’s still rolling out, and I need candy because I haven’t got it yet. And the other update is making faux investors lose their sleep.

## What’s going on here?

ChatGPT is getting upgrades to how it uses files and tools.

## What does that mean?

ChatGPT can now accept multiple files of different types at the same time. Many Chat with PDF apps were building their product around these features. As always OpenAI adding this feature was expected and the equally expected was the outrage that “Oh! Chat with PDF apps are dead.”

The tool usage appears as “all tools” in a chat using multiple tools. There are some rumours about another mode called “Magic Create,” but no deets about that.

## Why should I care?

Though the drama about your app being dead is not true, you’ve got to care a bit extra after this. Add additional features to your app, innovate on UI, focus on a niche, double down on marketing, you get the idea. There’s a lot to do.

As a ChatGPT user, I’ve been waiting for the all tools consolidation for a while. Try out the use cases that needed you to switch threads and lose context, it might perform better now.
