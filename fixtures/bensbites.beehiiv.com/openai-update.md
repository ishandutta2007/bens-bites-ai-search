Ahhhh Ben's Bites, the smorgasbord of AI nibbles. We're inching closer to GPT-4, any bets on when we will see it happening? I think before end of year.

We're also seeing a lot of samey-samey products showing us that speed is becoming a diminishing advantage in the age of AI. Great products are still tough to build.

Let's dive in.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- **OpenAI Text-Davinci-003 has been released**. OpenAI says that it produces higher-quality writing, more complex instruction and better long-form content. It is still trained on the same data as text-davinci-002 but tweaked differently. Is this a little taster for GPT-4? Will it be released at NeurIPS?!
  - A few observations on where it‚Äôs improved and not vs 002 ([link](https://twitter.com/blennon_/status/1597374826305318912)).
  - It can write rhyming poems now. ([link](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1597428992037953537))
  - [Here's a collab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1atz4xfZLpIHJKD2kf38WnxHv61XU-dwb#scrollTo=AwMvOBCEDoxC) to easily run comparisons against text-davinci-002.

- Modal Podcast Transcriber - Transcribe any podcast episode in just 1-2 minutes. This tool is pretty incredible. It says what it does on the cover! ([link](https://modal.com/docs/guide/whisper-transcriber))
- GPT Index is a project consisting of a set of data structures that are created using GPT-3 and can be traversed **using GPT-3 in order to answer queries**. ([link](https://github.com/jerryjliu/gpt_index)) A short thread on its capabilities. ([link](https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1596935176084328449))

### **üõ†Ô∏è Cool Tools**
