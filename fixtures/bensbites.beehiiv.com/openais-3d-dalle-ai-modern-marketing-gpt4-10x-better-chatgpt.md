On the 21st day of Christmas my true love gave to me, an email talking about 3D DALL-E. Related; when do the 'days of Christmas' actually start?

Ho, Ho, Holy crap I've got to stop with the Christmas references.

Let's get to it.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

**Self-Instruct: Aligning language model with self generated instructions**. So what's the story here? OpenAI can get a large amount of user data and afford to pay many human annotators for their InstructGPT. What if you can't afford to do that? This team instruction-tuned the GPT3 model and tested how good it can be at following new instructions. The result? Self-instructed GPT3 (which barely uses any human annotation) outperformed those trained on other public datasets, performing close to InstructGPT-001. Exciting!! ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10560))

OpenAI prototype of **3D DALLE** (called ‚ÄúPoint-E‚Äù) is open sourced. ([link](https://github.com/openai/point-e)) Of course, there's already a Hugging Face demo for the new text-to-3D model. ([link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/anzorq/point-e_demo)) TechCrunch article [here](https://techcrunch.com/2022/12/20/openai-releases-point-e-an-ai-that-generates-3d-models/). And you can read the arXiv research paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08751).

Deleted tweet from Rippling co-founder: **Microsoft is all-in on GPT. GPT-4 10x better than 3.5(ChatGPT)**, clearing turing test and any standard tests. ([link](https://twitter.com/AliYeysides/status/1605258835974823954))

**This Detroit startup aims to shape the future of video creation with AI (Sponsor).**\
Small Michigan startup Waymark is trying to break down barriers to video creation with the help of AI. With Waymark, users just type in basic information, and a team of AI models generates a complete marketing video for them in minutes. It looks like this approach is already picking up steam - Waymark has a few enterprise clients under its belt and has been listed in both Hulu and Roku's creative directories.\
