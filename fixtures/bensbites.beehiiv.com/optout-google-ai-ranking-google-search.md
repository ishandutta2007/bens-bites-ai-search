# Opt-out of Google AI while ranking on Google Search

[Google has launched a new tool to allow websites to opt out](https://blog.google/technology/ai/an-update-on-web-publisher-controls/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=opt-out-of-google-ai-while-ranking-on-google-search) of having their content used to train AI models while still being indexed by Google Search.

## What's going on here?

Google has created an opt-out tool for websites to control whether their content helps improve Google's AI models like Bard and Vertex.

## What does this mean?

The tool, called Google-Extended, allows sites to block their content from training Google's AI while still being crawled and indexed by Googlebot. This gives publishers more control over access to their content.

## Why should I care?

If you run a website, this tool gives you greater say over how your content is used, especially for sensitive domains where AI training could be problematic. Having a choice helps build trust with Google.
