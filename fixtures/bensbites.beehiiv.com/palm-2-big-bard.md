Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got some leaks about potential Google IO announcements and the comparison of AI risk with climate change.

Also, we have tools that save you AWS costs and help build with no-code.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

**Investors earn 325% annualized return here (really)**

While the ultra-rich have been banking off this under-the-radar asset for centuries, a group of everyday investors just used it to rake in a whopping 325% annualized gain.

Sounds nuts? It definitely is. *But it's also 100% true.*

The asset was a sculpture offered by the fractional art investment platform Masterworks. After just 36 days, investors were able to profit for a 15.4% net gain, a *triple-digit return* on an annualized basis.

While it‚Äôs not common for Masterworks to get a profitable exit that fast, every one of Masterworks‚Äô 13 exits has returned a profit to investors, totaling more than $35 million in payouts.

**Google**really has been receiving a healthy chunk of flack lately, with**OpenAI**seeming to continue outpacing them on the language model front. Their**Google I/O conference**tomorrow is a chance to get back into the game, and according to CNBC they‚Äôre going to be announcing a new foundation model:**PaLM 2**. On top of this, they‚Äôll be announcing advancements on**Bard**, their equivalent of ChatGPT, where it‚Äôll have improvements in code generation and logic; and finally other Bard variants, interestingly-named Big Bard and Giant Bard‚Ä¶

[Geoffrey Hinton thinks AI poses a greater threat than climate change](https://nypost.com/2023/05/08/godfather-of-ai-says-its-threat-is-more-urgent-than-climate-change/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=palm-2-and-big-bard)

**Geoffrey Hinton‚Äôs**Google resignation last week was hot stuff, and his promise to be open and honest about AI safety is starting to take shape. His first statement we‚Äôve seen is just about as hard-hitting as it could have been: AI poses a larger**existential threat**than climate change. Jeez! The reason? With climate change there‚Äôs a clear solution - stop burning coal. With AI the solution just isn‚Äôt clear. That being said, Hinton isn‚Äôt on board with the recent proposition to pause the training of AI, but undoubtedly thinks that resources should be thrown at alignment research to get it going effectively.

Anyone who‚Äôs involved with managing modern-day tech budgets will likely be aware of the eye-watering feeling of looking at a mighty**AWS bill**for using their cloud tech. Startup[Antimetal](https://www.antimetal.com/?utm_source=Product+Hunt\&utm_medium=Product+Hunt\&utm_campaign=Product+Hunt+Launch\&ref=producthunt)has been using AI to build a product that**finds inefficiencies**in what you‚Äôre using on the cloud, studies the**AWS Marketplace**, and finds buyers for the cloud instances you don‚Äôt need. And they claim that it does this**3x faster**than if you tried doing it yourself. With budgets becoming increasingly constrained in the tech world, this technology could be pretty huge, and I think is gonna start to pick up a lot of focus.

[Feathery AI: No more boring form building](https://ai.feathery.io/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=palm-2-and-big-bard#Step%201)

Let's face it, we all know how mind-numbingly boring form building can be. Debating which questions to ask, what type of questions to use, and how to make it engaging for your audience is a real chore. Well, thankfully Feathery AI just launched their **AI form assistant**that makes whipping up web forms a breeze. You'll have a solid form foundation to work in seconds and can fine-tune it in their nifty editor.
