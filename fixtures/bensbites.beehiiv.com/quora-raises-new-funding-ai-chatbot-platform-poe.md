## What does that mean?

Quora is now valued at $500M, much lower than its peak valuation of $2B+ in 2021. But excluding Poe, Quora is cash flow positive, so all of this new funding will be used on Poe.

## Why should I care?

OpenAI’s GPT store is launching this week. That also aims to offer creator monetization. Poe also provides models other than OpenAI’s GPTs for developers to use.
