# Replit AI is for everyone.

[Replit is bringing the AI treats](https://blog.replit.com/ai4all?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=replit-ai-is-for-everyone) early this Halloween. AI features like code completion and assistance will now be available for all users on their platform, not just paid Pro accounts.

## What’s going on here?

Replit is releasing its AI capabilities to all its 23M+ users for free.

## What does this mean?

The common coder just hit the jackpot baby! Chaps on the free plan will have access to our basic AI features. Replit has also trained a new model, replit-code-v1.5-3b to power these new features in this massive rollout. This 3B parameter model is optimized for programming in 30 languages. Replit is claiming SOTA performance with this model among the 3B parameter models.

For the Pro users, it’s business as usual: they will get exclusive access to the most powerful AI models(which Amjad has said is GPT-4 right now) and advanced features.

## Why should I care?

Replit is letting go of the Ghostwriter brand to make AI and Replit synonymous. It is treating AI completion as autocorrect in a docs editor. Sure the free version may not be as juiced up, but it's a start. The native experience of coding will AI change how most developers create software and Replit be hookin' everybody up!
