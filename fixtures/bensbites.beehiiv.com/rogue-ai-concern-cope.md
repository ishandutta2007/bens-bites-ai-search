**1/**

[Andrew Ng responds to Gary Marcus‚Äôs ban on AI](https://twitter.com/andrewyng/status/1641121451611947009)

Remember the[pause AI letter](https://www.bensbites.co/p/pause-ai-immediately)we mentioned yesterday? Well, it has certainly kicked up a*reeeaaal*big fuss on the AI scene, and we‚Äôre here to keep you updated.

For those who don‚Äôt already know, Future of Life Institute created a**signable petition to halt the training**of large language models for a whole six months. And Gary Marcus (Neural Science prof. at NYU, and often a critic of the pace of AI advancements) heavily publicised it.

Now**Andrew Ng**, the tech world‚Äôs equivalent of David Attenborough and Coursera‚Äôs Co-founder, has waded in to put his foot down. He argues that having governments pause emerging technology they don‚Äôt understand is**anti-competitive at best**, and sets a terrible precedent at worst. It‚Äôs simply not feasible, and even if it was, it won‚Äôt help us get anywhere -**regulations around transparency**and auditing would help us navigate explosive tech far more effectively.

**2/**

[Pausing AI developments isn't enough. We need to shut it all down.](https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/?utm_source=www.bensbites.co\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=rogue-ai-concern-or-cope)

The doom and gloom trend doesn‚Äôt end there‚Ä¶ Time magazine posted an opinion piece saying the letter hasn‚Äôt gone far enough! Read itwithout the paywall [here](https://archive.vn/rmj4e?utm_source=www.bensbites.co\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=rogue-ai-concern-or-cope).

Eliezer Yodkowsky starts the piece with, ‚ÄúI refrained from signing because I think the letter is understating the seriousness of the situation and asking for too little to solve it.‚Äù Acc. to him,[AI will kill us all](https://www.bensbites.co/p/new-entries-aws-bain), so he is arguing that we simply are not prepared and it‚Äôs time to just ‚Äúshut it all down.‚Äù Sheesh!

It‚Äôs worth mentioning some balanced takeaways as well. This piece from Jon Stokes on[AI Safety - A technical & ethnographic overview](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/ai-safety-a-technical-and-ethnographic?utm_source=www.bensbites.co\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=rogue-ai-concern-or-cope) is worth a read.

This topic is starting to gain enough attention from big enough names that we might just see the higher powers step in soon‚Ä¶ luckily for us; those aren‚Äôt AI machines just yetüòâ.

**3/**

[The business model of providing access to models in return for data](https://sacks.substack.com/p/the-give-to-get-model-for-ai-startups?utm_source=www.bensbites.co\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=rogue-ai-concern-or-cope)

Now, I‚Äôm glad that I‚Äôm not quite old enough to remember Jigsaw, a start-up founded in 2004 (I was 14), and**David Sacks**argues that Jigsaw‚Äôs business model is overdue for a revival with this current wave of AI. The SaaS industry lives by the frameworks from David, so worth reading this.

The\*\*‚ÄòGive-to-Get‚Äô model,**where people could upload their business contact and receive access to contacts in response. See where this is going‚Ä¶? You got it. Why not apply the Give-to-Get model to datasets that can be used to train AIs? Hand over some data, and get access to powerful models in return. With baked-in earning points for activity that allows ‚Äòpurchase‚Äô access to more features. As the lifecycle of the framework goes forward, the power of the**models grows and it amplifies itself.\*\*I love it!

**4/**

[Playground AI release their v1 HD image generator](https://twitter.com/suhail/status/1641158701968134144)

It‚Äôs time to say hello to another awesome-looking**generative art model**, and this one is from**Playground AI**. Creatively called**Playground v1**, they claim that it‚Äôs able to improve the overall**HDR quality**of the images generated, and I have to say they do look damn crisp and detailed. You can try it out for free on their[website](https://playgroundai.com/?utm_source=www.bensbites.co\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=rogue-ai-concern-or-cope), where you‚Äôll see that you can even choose a photo style to dominate the image - and they come with snazzy descriptions like ‚Äúradiant symmetry‚Äù, ‚Äúominous escape‚Äù, and ‚Äúneon mecha‚Äù (whatever that is!).
