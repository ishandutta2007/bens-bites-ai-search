# Rogue AI drone - That didn't exist

### PLUS: Stack exchange is in trouble, AI in genetic research and Google's AI courses.

Hey folks, today we have the US airforce taking back some statements about AI attacking a human operator in a simulation.

Stack Exchange is facing a strike from its moderators, and researchers are using AI to improve genetic health disorder prediction.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

From our sponsor:

**3x wealth with doable ‚Äúside-hustle‚Äù of the rich?**

This ain‚Äôt dog-walking or drop-shipping. This is a side-hustle of the rich and famous that's helped them build wealth 3x faster than the average person. But now, you can do it too, just like tens of thousands of everyday people.

What is it? Buying and selling blue-chip art. Because the investment platform Masterworks has unlocked this exclusive asset, and it takes care of all the leg work.

Its investors have already benefited from more than $45 million in sales, earning annualized returns on their investment of 10.4%, 13.9%, and even 35%, with many more sales on the horizon. To join them, just[use this exclusive Ben‚Äôs Bites link to skip the waitlist!](https://www.masterworks.com/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=newsletter\&utm_campaign=6-5-23\&utm_term=Ben%27s+Bites+subscriber\&utm_content=3x_wealth+side_hustle+muscle)

[Researchers use AI to improve genetic health risk predictions in humans](https://www.ft.com/content/af659789-e14a-461d-9626-77f62a2bccd9?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=rogue-ai-drone-that-didn-t-exist)

There‚Äôs nothing quite like starting the week with a pick involving AI in medical advances - it puts a smile on my face! Using genetic information of about**800 primates across 233 species**of apes, monkeys, and lemurs, an AI algorithm was trained and used to**analyse DNA from 454,000 people**in the UK, and the results are brilliant. It‚Äôs showing**12% improved accuracy**in its ability to assess genetic risks of developing health problems, greatly improving genetic risk prediction. This is a great leap for health research!

[Stack Exchange moderators are going on strike due to the company‚Äôs AI policy](https://openletter.mousetail.nl?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=rogue-ai-drone-that-didn-t-exist)

One of life‚Äôs true beauties is that absolute treasure trove of knowledge and information: Stack Exchange. It‚Äôs certainly saved my ass many more times than once‚Ä¶ But they seem to have landed themselves in a spot of hot water with their own moderators.

They recently announced a\*\*near-total prohibition of moderation of AI-generated answers,\*\*after a flood of them began popping up over the Q\&A site, opening up risks of plagiarism and false answers. The prohibition has caused moderators to go on a Stack Exchange strike, claiming that the company is harming its own purpose. Well, at least it isn‚Äôt train drivers this time‚Ä¶

[US Air Force backtracks on its statement about the rogue AI drone test](https://www.channel4.com/news/factcheck/factcheck-did-an-ai-drone-kill-its-imaginary-human-operator?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=rogue-ai-drone-that-didn-t-exist)

When you cause a monumental cock-up, backtrack and hope that it‚Äôll all be OK. At least, that‚Äôs the approach that the**US Air Force**seems to be taking. After reports that a**Colonel said a rogue AI drone killed its human operator in simulation testing**(in other reports, destroyed the communication tower), the man in charge is\*\*now saying that he ‚Äúmis-spoke‚Äù\*\*and that no such experiment was ever even tested.

I was skeptical of this whole scene on Friday, so didn‚Äôt elaborate on it. Anyway, this whole facade teaches us a few lessons: 1) Misinformation can spread incredibly fast, and 2) Doomer AI-related misinformation can spread even faster.

This new model can lead to a\*\*wave of another AI image tools.**The previous one, DreamBooth from Google, was for keeping subjects consistent and many of the avatar projects used dream booth behind the scenes. This one does the same for**consistent style,\*\*which is huge task for graphics designers.
