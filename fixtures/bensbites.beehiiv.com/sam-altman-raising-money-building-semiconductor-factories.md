# Sam Altman is raising money for building semiconductor factories.

Sam Altman, the big boss at OpenAI, is on a mission to [raise billions for a new chip venture.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/altman-seeks-to-raise-billions-for-network-of-ai-chip-factories?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-is-raising-money-for-building-semiconductor-factories) More deets from Bloomberg that he's betting big on setting up a global network of semiconductor factories.

## What’s going on here?

Sam Altman is back on his plan to create network of factories for semiconductor manufacturing.

## What does this mean?

Altman's looking ahead, seeing a future where AI's everywhere but chips are scarce. His plan goes one step beyond than the usual tech giant strategy of designing chips and leaving the (hard) work of making them to others.

Altman's wants OpenAI to build its own network of chip factories (fabs). He’s playing a different game and a long one—with the goal to have sufficient chip supply by the end of the decade.

He's talking with G42 and SoftBank to raise money. Bloomberg reports that Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, knows about this plan and is interested in it.

## Why should I care?

Building a network of state-of-the-art fabs is expensive and time-consuming. Previous reports mention talks of raising up to $10 billion with G42. It's a bold move, especially since companies like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft prefer to outsource manufacturing. If Altman's right, and there's a chip crunch as AI booms, we know which company is gonna be ahead of the game.
