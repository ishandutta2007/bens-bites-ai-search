# Sam Altman wants to make hardware AI now

Renowned iPhone [designer Jony Ive and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman have been in talks](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/designer-jony-ive-and-open-ais-sam-altman-discuss-ai-hardware-project?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-wants-to-make-hardware-ai-now) about collaborating on a new consumer AI hardware device, according to sources familiar with the conversations. SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son has also discussed the idea with them.

## What's going on here?

If Ive and Altman move forward, their alliance could produce an influential new AI gadget amid rising competition between tech giants.

## What does this mean?

A joint consumer device from Ive's design studio LoveFrom and leading AI lab OpenAI would be a high-profile partnership. It signals OpenAI's ambitions beyond software to make physical products that shape how AI impacts daily life. The device's details are unclear, but it would leverage both leaders' strengths.

## Why should I care?

For consumers, an Ive-OpenAI device could bring innovative AI capabilities packaged in irresistible hardware, like Ive did with Apple products. It may accelerate AI's integration into people's homes.

For OpenAI, the device could be a foothold against rivals like Google and Meta. OpenAI has led generative AI with ChatGPT, but competition is fierce. Unique consumer tech powered by OpenAI's AI would help differentiate it.

The collaboration is still tentative. Many big tech companies have tried and failed at hit consumer hardware. But if Ive, OpenAI and possibly SoftBank join forces, they could create something transformative. Their pedigrees and complementary skills suggest this is a partnership to watch closely.
