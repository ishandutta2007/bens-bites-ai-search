Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got Sam Altman of Open AI, Prof. Gary Marcus, and Christina Montgomery of IBM testifying in front of the US Congress to avoid AI misuse.

Then there‚Äôs Zoom, partnering with Anthropic to help customer support agents and Apple, launching features to help the physically disabled. Also, Zapier launched two more AI features to make automating your tasks easier without writing code.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[Sam Altman testifies to Congress on AI safety and regulation](https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-chief-goes-before-us-congress-propose-licenses-building-ai-2023-05-16/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-s-testimony-for-ai-regulation)

Looks like Sam Altman of**OpenAI**is on a mission to get into the government‚Äôs good books‚Ä¶ Yesterday was awash with news stories covering his**appearance in Congress**, where he and others like Gary Marcus and Christina Montgomery (CPO @IBM) were discussing the future of**AI regulation and safety**. Good to see! They covered topics like election interference - a ‚Äúsignificant area of concern‚Äù;**licensing and testing requirements**before model releases, which he thinks the gov should consider; and the fact that manipulating human actions is a major AI threshold point for going too far.

Coverage from the[WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpts-sam-altman-faces-senate-panel-examining-artificial-intelligence-4bb6942a?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-s-testimony-for-ai-regulation)and[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-16/a-us-senator-just-used-chatgpt-for-opening-remarks-at-a-hearing?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-s-testimony-for-ai-regulation), and[Stability AI chiming in](https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-letter-us-senate-ai-oversight?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-s-testimony-for-ai-regulation)as well.

[Zoom partner with Anthropic to bring Claude to their services](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725342/zoom-anthropic-ai-powered-chatbot-claude?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-s-testimony-for-ai-regulation)

**Zoom**is*zooming*back into the AI-related news arena again (sorry about that), and this time they‚Äôre announcing a partnership with**Anthropic**to integrate the**Claude chatbot**into their services. Unfortunately, it‚Äôs a pretty dull use case - using it to help customer support agents**guide customers to relevant solutions.**

Hey, at least you‚Äôre less likely to get stuck trying to figure out why the hell your call isn‚Äôt working. Their**in-house AI tech**is able to do things like generate meeting summaries and create whiteboards, so I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôll sneak Claude into those services at some point!

**3/**

[Apple bring a suite of features to assist the physically disabled](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/16/apple-reveals-upcoming-accessibility-features-for-iphone-ipad-and-mac/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-s-testimony-for-ai-regulation)

**Apple**released a whole host of new features yesterday focussing around**helping the physically impaired**- you gotta love to see it! The features involve**cognitive, vision, and speech capabilities**, and some of them are damn cool.

**Point & Speak**helps users identify objects in the room (e.g. microwave) and helps to identify which buttons do what (I could probably do with that for my unnecessarily complicated oven). A voice tool also helps tune a phone assistant voice to your own, and doesn‚Äôt store any of the data - including Apple themselves.

[Zapier launches 2 AI Beta features](https://zapier.com/blog/ai-open-letter/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=sam-altman-s-testimony-for-ai-regulation)

The folks at Zapier have been going hard into bringing AI to everyone. I saw it firsthand during my time at Zapier and they are not stopping. They have now released two features combining no-code and AI.

The first one is **creating zaps with natural English**. Just enter what you want done and it‚Äôll create a zap for you. The other one is to bring**coding abilities to customize your zaps,** but the catch is: you don‚Äôt have to write code. Again explain what you need done and it‚Äôll write the code for you. It‚Äôs insane!! Check it out.
