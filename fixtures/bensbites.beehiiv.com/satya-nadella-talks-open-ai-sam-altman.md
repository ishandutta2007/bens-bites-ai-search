## What does that mean?

OpenAI’s non-profit board fired Sam Altman on Friday ([catch up here](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/open-ai-fires-sam-altman-weekend-drama-summarized)). Satya welcomed Sam and Greg to Microsoft and the OpenAI employees are pressuring the board to resign and bring Sam back.

- I’m not being told about anything about \[what Sam did] (1). Open AI’s governance needs to change after this ”event” (2).

- There is no OpenAI without Microsoft leaning in to partner in a deep way. We have everything to serve our customers if Open AI disappeared tomorrow (3).

- We are open for Sam and Greg to go back to Open AI, but they’ll keep doing business with Microsoft in any case (1). I’m open to both options (2).

- We have a place for every OpenAI employee that wants to come to Microsoft. And will keep supporting the ones who choose to stay at OpenAI (3).

In addition, Sam Altman [tweeted](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1726686611260494238?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=satya-nadella-talks-about-open-ai-and-sam-altman) that both his and Satya’s priority is to keep OpenAI thriving.
