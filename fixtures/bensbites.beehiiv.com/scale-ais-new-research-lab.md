# Scale AI's new research lab

Scale AI is unveiling a new research initiative called the [Safety, Evaluations, and Analysis Lab](https://scale.com/blog/safety-evaluations-analysis-lab?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=scale-ai-s-new-research-lab) (SEAL) to establish safety benchmarks and evaluation products for deploying large language models (LLMs).

## Whatâ€™s going on here?

Scale is ramping up investments in advanced red teaming and evaluation methods to enhance transparency and standardization around LLM safety.

## What does this mean?

Currently, each AI company establishes safety guidelines in-house, which can be inefficient and overlook key risks. Scale plans to collaborate with regulators and the AI community to develop comprehensive LLM safety evaluation products and benchmarks applicable across the industry. This aims to mitigate common safety risks outlined in the executive order on AI, like cybersecurity and deceptive content. The SEAL team will conduct research to improve evaluation reliability, apply red teaming techniques, and develop LLM-based automated rating systems.

## Why should I care?

Standardized safety benchmarks will increase accountability and transparency for companies deploying LLMs. More rigorous evaluation methods can help identify and mitigate risks early. As AI becomes deeply integrated into products and services, consumers need assurance LLMs align with ethical principles. More open collaboration on safety practices will also accelerate AI progress responsibly.
