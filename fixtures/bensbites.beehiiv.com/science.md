Ello ello, and welcome to the 104 new folk joining us since yesterday.

We've got a big feast today, take it slow, and peruse at your own pace, perhaps you've got a load of pointless meetings today and you want to just look at cool stuff. Well, I've got you.

Let's get to it.

*p.s. Emad from StabilityAI is doing an [AMA on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/yw6s1i/d_ama_the_stability_ai_team/) today if you wanna ask any Qs (in between meetings, of course*üòè\*).\*

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

Galactica launched with a big bang (üòâ). [**A large language model for science**](https://galactica.org/) that can **summarise academic literature, solve math problems, generate Wiki articles, write scientific code, annotate molecules and proteins**, and more. It has been trained with 48 million papers, textbooks and lecture notes, millions of compounds and proteins, scientific websites, encyclopedias and more. Sound smart, be dumb, like me.

[**A curated library of prompts**](https://www.prompt.cafe/)**.**

[**Notion QA Bot: ask questions on your Notion database and receive an accurate, conversational response back**](https://github.com/hwchase17/notion-qa). Similar to Ask My Book we saw yesterday. I think we‚Äôll see lots of these kinds of products - I want one for my Airtable base to easily search links that have been included!

Tutorial: [**Training video classification models**](https://twitter.com/RisingSayak/status/1592389454026506240) easily.

Turn yourself into an AR character. [**Using AI to create a digital twin**](https://twitter.com/XRarchitect/status/1592542900839395329) and then bringing it into an interactive augmented reality experience.

[**Large Language Models struggle to learn long-tail knowledge**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08411). The number of documents a language model is exposed to during pre-training affects its ability to answer fact-based questions.

[**Semantic information from language models can be incorporated into self-supervised speech encoders without labelled audio transcriptions**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.08402).

[**Text-guided real image editing**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07825) does not require fine-tuning or optimization and can be applied to a single real image.
