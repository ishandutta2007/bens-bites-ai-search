Hey folks, Ben again.

Today we have Grimes allowing her fans to create deepfake music, OpenAI being protective of term GPT, and another not-so-good AI launch for Snap.

Let’s get to it.

[Famous musicians are divided over whether to embrace or reject AI](https://www.forbes.com/sites/martineparis/2023/04/24/grimes-tells-fans-to-deepfake-drake-her-welcomes-collaboration-with-ai/?sh=559f807515c0\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=musicians-choose-to-make-money-with-deepfakes)

You’ve gotta love it when AI and the mainstream collide to create a big old drama. It was only a few days ago that AI was used to create a**fake Drake song**(not my cup of tea personally) that ended up with a ridiculous number of listens and Universal Music Group calling the creator out for being a naughty boy. Now, the artist**Grimes**(no clue who that is, but apparently she’s big) is offering to[split royalties](https://twitter.com/grimezsz/status/1650304051718791170)50/50 with anyone who can muster up an AI version of herself. That’s the attitude we like to see!

But whatever side different artists take, there are real legal issues that’ll have to be addressed at some point, and Semafor takes a quick look[here](https://www.semafor.com/article/04/18/2023/is-ai-generated-music-legal?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=musicians-choose-to-make-money-with-deepfakes).

[“GPT” may be trademarked soon if OpenAI has its way](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/24/gpt-may-be-trademarked-soon-if-openai-has-its-way/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=musicians-choose-to-make-money-with-deepfakes)

Let’s play trademark trademark. Open AI kicked the bowl first in December by filing a trademark for GPT. But sad for them, they missed the goalpost and their\*\*petition got declined.\*\*They are applying again but in addition to that they have released “[brand guidelines](https://openai.com/brand?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=musicians-choose-to-make-money-with-deepfakes)” for crediting usage of their models.

Basically, you can write built with or powered by GPT4. etc. but\*\*can’t add GPT to the name like “laptopGPT.”\*\*A bunch of other guidelines in there with “guess which logo is correct” game at the end (iykyk).

Let’s see how well this will age.

[Snapchat’s in-app chatbot hasn’t gone down as well as expected](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/24/snapchat-sees-spike-in-1-star-reviews-as-users-pan-the-my-ai-feature-calling-for-its-removal/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=musicians-choose-to-make-money-with-deepfakes)

Uh oh,**Snapchat**seems to have a bit of a flop on their hands. A few months ago they threw their own chatbot,**My AI**, into the Snap app, and it hasn’t gone down particularly well - with 1-star ratings going from 35% up to 75%, and lots of complaints about the chatbot - sheesh! One of the primary complaints is having an annoying little bot taking up real estate where their actual friends would usually be. For me, this is a demonstration of AI chatbots as something to engage with for fun and convo being a bit of a fad. It\*\*looks like the youngsters using Snap would much rather chat with, I dunno, their friends?\*\*Seems fair.

**4/**

[Runway release their AI video generation app](https://twitter.com/runwayml/status/1650485456381829124)

If you wanna keep in touch with the video side of AI art generation, I reckon**Runway**are gonna be one of the ones to watch. Their name just keeps popping up with all things video! They’ve now released an**app called RunwayML**, which will be their commercial base for users to engage with**AI-generated videos**. At the moment it can only be used to create some funky - and also kinda creepy - edits of your videos, but coming soon is text-to-video… One catch: free credits are limited and it’s not cheap after that.
