[Stability AI release a suite of large language models called StableLM](https://stability.ai/blog/stability-ai-launches-the-first-of-its-stablelm-suite-of-language-models?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-release-their-llm)

**Stability AI**really is the gift that keeps on giving at the moment. Having made a*big*namefor themselves on the image generation stage with**Stable Diffusion**, they‚Äôre now making their mark with language models.**StableLM**is their in-house suite that they‚Äôre making open-source to both developers and commerce. With current ranges of 3B to 7B parameters, they have plans to release models with up to 65 billion, trained on**1.5 trillion tokens**. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but that‚Äôd be the biggest open-source language model available, right? And they‚Äôve even got a catch-phrase to boot: ‚ÄúTransparent, Accessible, Supportive‚Äù.

The folks at Banana have already made a[template for Stable LM](https://app.banana.dev/templates/sahil280114/serverless-template-stableLM?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-release-their-llm)deployment. The official Github repo from Stability AI is[here](https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableLM?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-release-their-llm).

[This open-source initiative is going head-to-head with the ChatGPT Plugin Protocol](https://twitter.com/maccaw/status/1648698052058791936)

The**open-source**fight is gaining serious momentum and going pretty strong right now, and this time the goal is to prevent the AI world from producing a monopoly like Apple‚Äôs App Store. The concerns have arisen with OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT Plugin Protocol, a kind of app store where websites and APIs can be used as part of ChatGPT‚Äôs responses to prompts.

Alex started[openpm.ai](http://openpm.ai?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-release-their-llm), with the aim of creating a fully open**package manager for OpenAPI files**- that essentially means that any app/site with an API can be used and integrated into a language model from a kind of app store. It‚Äôll basically be a free-to-use version of the Plugin Protocol. Let‚Äôs see how open OpenAI really is with their reaction to this one‚Ä¶

[The start-up looking to revolutionise AI with biological development from stem cells](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/cortical-labs-raises-10m-for-its-pong-playing-stem-cells-which-eventually-could-power-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-release-their-llm)

Strap yourself in because I‚Äôve picked some seriously futuristic SciFi-sounding shizz for today‚Äôs business. A company called**Cortical Labs**out in Oz has just received\*\*$10m**in funding for what they call**Organoid Intelligence\*\*. This is the generation of biological neurons using human stem cells, and they plan to use them to create a biological operating system that can power AI. In fact, they‚Äôve already demonstrated that a version of this system in a Petri dish was able to**learn how to play a game**called Pong. I‚Äôm not sure what that is, but the whole idea sounds super cool, and who knows, maybe this‚Äôll blow the current state of AI outta the water at some point in the future.

**[Atlassian Intelligence comes to Jira and Confluence](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/announcements/unleashing-power-of-ai?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-release-their-llm)**

Jira is the lifeline of all the product teams out there, and**Atlassian is bringing AI**to it now. They are grouping the range of options in their demo under two categories: service related work and product related work.

Just like all other big companies adding AI to their tools, this has **a chatbot, a meeting assistant, summaries for support requests, and documentation generation** for features and product plans. The video demos load slowly on the official announcement, so here is [Techcrunch coverage for a brief overview.](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/19/atlassian-brings-an-ai-assistant-to-jira-and-confluence/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-release-their-llm)

This all is great, but I‚Äôm waiting for this to come to Trello. (if you don‚Äôt know, Atlassian acquired Trello some years back)
