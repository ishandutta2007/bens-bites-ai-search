# Stability AI's new model, StableLM Zephyr 3B, can run on smartphones.

[Stability AI introduces StableLM Zephyr 3B](https://stability.ai/news/stablelm-zephyr-3b-stability-llm?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-s-new-model-stablelm-zephyr-3b-can-run-on-smartphones), a new 3 billion parameter AI assistant model from StableLM designed to provide accurate and fast text generation on regular hardware.

## What's going on here?

StableLM Zephyr 3B brings the power of large language models to more devices.

## What does this mean?

Stable LM Zephyr 3B is built by fine-tuning on diverse datasets to compress more capability in smaller size. Zephyr 3B matches or exceeds the performance of multiple 7B models on instruction following, QA tasks, and text generation quality. The magic of a small 3B model is that users can get responsiveness and accuracy without expensive hardware.

Zephyr is being released under a [non-commercial license](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-zephyr-3b/raw/main/LICENSE?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=stability-ai-s-new-model-stablelm-zephyr-3b-can-run-on-smartphones) that permits non-commercial use.

## Why should I care?

Smaller high-performing models like Zephyr 3B mean you can try building capable AI tools for more average hardware setups. Products powered by Zephyr 3B could work well on phones, tablets, laptops etc. Iâ€™m interested to see how people create tiny personal tools with Zephyr.
