Hello folks, here’s what we have today;

##### **<mark>Our picks</mark>**

**1/**

[**OpenAI**](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=super-alignment-before-super-intelligence)[are jumping back on the alignment bandwagon](https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=super-alignment-before-super-intelligence)with the brilliantly-named**Superalignment Team**. And you guessed it - they’re**researching alignment of future superintelligent AIs**. They reckon that AI can align other AI faster than humans can, and the plan is to build an AI that does just that. Head-spinning stuff…

[**Playground**](https://blog.playgroundai.com/playground-raises-40m-to-advance-the-field-of-computer-graphics/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=super-alignment-before-super-intelligence)[, the fast-moving image AI start-up, has just raised](https://blog.playgroundai.com/playground-raises-40m-to-advance-the-field-of-computer-graphics/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=super-alignment-before-super-intelligence)**[$40m](https://blog.playgroundai.com/playground-raises-40m-to-advance-the-field-of-computer-graphics/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=super-alignment-before-super-intelligence)** **to set the bar for improving graphics with AI**. They think that image AI is seriously lacking language models, and they plan to get it up to speed. They’ll be building a state-of-the-art AI graphics editor, and primarily working towards**models that can understand and handle pixels in images**. Think DragGAN but better.

[**ChatGPT has just been hit with its first serious lawsuit**](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/05/authors-file-a-lawsuit-against-openai-for-unlawfully-ingesting-their-books?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=super-alignment-before-super-intelligence)[,](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jul/05/authors-file-a-lawsuit-against-openai-for-unlawfully-ingesting-their-books?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=super-alignment-before-super-intelligence)and this time the accusers aren’t the usual visual artists, but writers. These two authors claim that OpenAI has breached copyright by including their books in its training set. Their evidence: ChatGPT can accurately summarise their books. Seems like a shaky argument to me…
