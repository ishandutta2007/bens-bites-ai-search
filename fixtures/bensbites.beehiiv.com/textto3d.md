Hey everyone! Welcome to the 210 new folks joining since Friday.

I'm testing a new format today so you'll notice that I've split things into sections; Ben's picks - for any major stuff I think is worth checking out, cool tool - self-explanatory, research - any arXiv or scientific breakthroughs, and then everything else.

This is to help skim-ability and not overwhelm. Making it easier to pay attention to the stuff you want.

Please reply with 'better' or 'worse' so I can see your feedback :)

## **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- **Magic3D from Nvidia: High-resolution text-to-3D content creation**. It can create high-quality 3D textured mesh models from input text prompts and utilizes a coarse-to-fine strategy that leverages both low- and high-resolution diffusion priors for learning the 3D representation of the target content. Magic3D synthesizes 3D content with 8√ó higher-resolution supervision than DreamFusion while also being 2√ó faster. ([link](https://deepimagination.cc/Magic3D/))
- Buildspace wrote a guide: **Prompt Engineering 101**. You can probably guess what it‚Äôs about üòâ but their images are so dope I‚Äôd check it out just to attempt to replicate similar. ([link](https://lol.framer.website/notes/prompt-engineering-101-sd))
- MultiRay by Meta: a new platform for **running state-of-the-art AI models at scale**. It allows **multiple models to run on the same input** and **shares the majority of the processing costs** while incurring only a small per-model cost. ([link](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/multiray-large-scale-AI-models/))
- **Canva text-to-image**. Canva, the multi-billion dollar design app, is now able to generate images from text. It makes a lot of sense and was only a matter of time. ([link](https://www.canva.com/your-apps/text-to-image))
