Hey folks! This is Ben's Bites - we're the lead singer and you're the backing vocals. We both need each other to make this thing sound beautiful.

I'm flying to Austin tomorrow, get there in time for dinner and I've got to amuse myself Sat eve and all day Sunday. If you have any recommendations - tweet them at me [@bentossell](https://twitter.com/bentossell/)

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

**[MusicLM: Generating Music From Text, via Google.](https://google-research.github.io/seanet/musiclm/examples/)**

Holy shit. It's text to music! Go and listen to the examples on the link - its so impressive.

I really struggle to find music I like (old-school hip-hop) because it's just not maaayyaayyyayyyde that wayyyyayyyayyy any more. (sorry about that). Democratising the creation of music is huge. It'll be interesting to see what's built on top of this in the future. Low-fi playlists, white noise, bathroom music, anything!

This article provides a list of musical prompts and the corresponding audio elements that can be used to create a variety of musical pieces.

Different musical prompts can be used to create different audio elements, audio elements can be used to create a variety of musical pieces, and different musical pieces can be created with different audio elements.

**2/**

**[MAV3D: Text-To-4D Dynamic Scene Generation, via Meta.](https://make-a-video3d.github.io/)**

This article presents MAV3D, a method for generating three-dimensional dynamic scenes from text descriptions.

MAV3D uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) to generate dynamic video output, it does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos, and it is the first to generate 3D dynamic scenes given a text description.

**3/**

When in Rome, do as the Romans do... The modern-day version is ‚Äúwhen in meetings, do as the Japanese do‚Äù. *Inemuri* is the Japanese art of ‚Äúsleeping whilst being present‚Äù, and now you can practise it too with [**Supernormal‚Äôs AI tool**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/25/supernormal-raises-10m-to-automatically-transcribe-and-summarize-meetings/) for **summarising meetings**, which just received $10m in funding and has over 50,000 users at some *big* firms. It‚Äôs setting itself apart from the competition with the ability to extract actions and critical decisions.

**4/**

Is this the [**first case of generative AI being used in Hollywood**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/26/23570967/chatgpt-author-scientific-papers-springer-nature-ban)? The Oscar-tipped film *Everything* *Everywhere All At Once*reportedly used Runway‚Äôs **generative video editing tool** in their VFX team. If you‚Äôve seen this *insane*film with *insane*special effects and *insane*cinematography, you could totally see how this could be the case.

There are a lot of text2video-type tools and tech coming out at the moment, but [**Atin Gupta outlines**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/26/23570967/chatgpt-author-scientific-papers-springer-nature-ban) how they all fall quite short of the real deal: a mish-mash of videos-with-no-sound, human-portrait-videos-with-sound, and video editors, but nothing yet combining all 3. Bring on the first person who can nail that combo!
