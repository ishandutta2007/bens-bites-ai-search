# Toss a coin to the Bard (Advanced)

Google is preparing to launch a paid upgrade to its AI chatbot Bard, called Bard Advanced. Google announced Bard Advanced with its Gemini models in December, saying it’ll be launched early this year. Seems like they truly meant early because the production [code hidden within the Bard website](https://twitter.com/evowizz/status/1742939270644748747?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=toss-a-coin-to-the-bard-advanced) highlights many upcoming features.

## What’s going on here?

Google’s about to release Bard’s paid version with new features.

## What does that mean?

It’s likely Bard Advanced will be bundled with Google's storage subscription service Google One, though there’s not much detail on which tiers will have Bard Advanced. Bard Advanced will use Google’s best model yet, Gemini Ultra, which [“seemingly” beat GPT-4.](https://bensbites.beehiiv.com/p/googles-gemini-beats-gpt4-cost)

With Bard Advanced there are a bunch of new features that might come:

**1) GPT-like bots.** These are codenamed Mokoto in the leaks and code [screenshots](https://twitter.com/bedros_p/status/1742626910088126566?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=toss-a-coin-to-the-bard-advanced) have URL structure as “/bots/create”. These might be custom chatbots like OpenAI’s GPTs.

**2) Prompt improvements.** A feature called Power Up would expand your simple prompts into advanced, better prompts.

In addition, there’s an**inspiration gallery** (suggesting prompts and ways to use AI have been a go-to move by Google and Bard) and **background images for shared chats.** Pure aesthetics and I’m here for it.

Other features like Tasks and Sparkle are also in the Twitter chatter but there’s not much info on them yet.
