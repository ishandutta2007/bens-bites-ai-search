Hello folks, here’s what we have today;

##### <mark>**Our picks**</mark>

**1/**

So two different pieces of news to highlight the\*\*US government’s interest in generative AI.**First, theUS Department of Defence announces the establishment of a[**generative AI task force**](https://www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3489803/dod-announces-establishment-of-generative-ai-task-force/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=us-govt-goes-to-the-ai-school)**.\*\*Next, politicians and policymakers attended[**Stanford’s bootcamp to educate Congress**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/11/congressional-bootcamp-stanford/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=us-govt-goes-to-the-ai-school)on deepfakes, generative AI, and more.

[Scale AI launches its Test & Evaluation platform for LLMs](https://scale.com/llm-test-evaluation?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=us-govt-goes-to-the-ai-school).This system is**already being used by Open AI**and will be used in the testing for the White House hackathon announced last week. The waitlist is open for early access now.

Scale’s team has also written a[blog outlining their vision of building trust in AI](https://scale.com/blog/test-evaluation-vision?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=us-govt-goes-to-the-ai-school)systems and what testing and evaluation standards should measure.

**3/**

[What if generative AI turned out to be a dud?](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-if-generative-ai-turned-out?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=us-govt-goes-to-the-ai-school)It’s been ages since I’ve included a Gary Marcus post in the picks. He makes the claim that**Gen AI companies are overvalued**due to promises like achieving AGI—which he is a vocal critic of.

He uses Twitter anecdotes, the fall in ChatGPT usage stats, and hallucinations to prove his point. However, to me, much of this discourse resembles\*\*riding the “anti-AI hype”\*\*than factual deduction.
