Hey folks, this is Ben‚Äôs Bites - your AI copilot. Today we‚Äôve got big companies like HubSpot showing their AI cards with new tools, Microsoft continue to roll out their AI functionality across their product suite and two new models from Google; a vision language model and a language model (tad confusing).

Let‚Äôs get to it.

### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**[ChatSpot - the power of ChatGPT + Hubspot](https://chatspot.ai/)

Hubspot's big entry in the AI game is called ChatSpot. This is one of the two best name plays I've seen from established brands integrating AI in their products. The other one is Zapbots from Zapier (not biased üòâ)

There are two categories of use cases for ChatSpot that Hubspot is highlighting:\
a)**eliminating manual work**like data entry and follow-up emails\
b)**understanding all the data**with natural language prompts

With the amount of marketing and sales data enterprises have with Hubspot, these are game-changing features. In addition to this, they have released a**Content Assistant**to generate blog ideas and outlines.

Check the announcement here:[Introducing HubSpot's new AI tools.](https://www.hubspot.com/artificial-intelligence)

**2/**[Microsoft brings an AI-powered Copilot to its business app suite](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/06/microsoft-dynamics-copilot/)

Microsoft has also added AI functionality to a bunch of apps in its business ecosystem, primarily targeting sales and marketing users. The addition to the Dynamics 365 is called Copilot, and similar to Github‚Äôs Copilot making coding easy for developers, it aims to make selling easy for salespeople. According to Bloomberg, Nadella sees this as a step towards making**one Biz App workflow**instead of separate CRMs, ERPs, etc.

Power platform from Microsoft also got the AI upgrade with conversation boosters in Power Virtual Agents and GPT model in Power Automate. The Power platform is a set of no-code solutions and new AI features embed text generation in those solutions.

The**next update**from Microsoft is on March 16th for ‚Äúworkspace productivity,‚Äù which probably means Office 365.

**3/**[PALM-E](https://palm-e.github.io/)**and**[USM](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/03/universal-speech-model-usm-state-of-art.html)**- Two new models from Google.**

As always, where others are adding AI to products, Google is releasing more papers on new models.*(when will they ship products?!!)*

First one is PALM-E, a **general-purpose vision language model** trained with 562 billion parameters. This combines the visual question-answer capacity of language models with robotics to perform actions in the real world. This [thread](https://twitter.com/DannyDriess/status/1632904675124035585) from one of the authors gives an overview of the model.

In November last year, Google announced its plans to make a language model with **automatic speech recognition** that supports 1000 languages. They are making steps towards it with the Universal Speech Model (USM). The Verge also reported it here: [Google‚Äôs one step closer to building its 1,000-language AI model.](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/6/23627788/google-1000-language-ai-universal-speech-model)

\*\*When:\*\*March 15th, 2023

**What is it about:** Given the size of computer vision datasets, identifying what to label, ensuring high label quality, and curating the right datasets at scale are challenges that can make or break your Computer Vision application in production.

In this webinar, we'll show you how to save time, money and sanity by building efficient data-centric workflows for Computer Vision applications.

**Who is it for:** Whether you're already working on a computer vision project or just getting started, this webinar is for you!
