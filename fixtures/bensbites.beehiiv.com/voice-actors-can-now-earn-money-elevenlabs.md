The pitch from ElevenLabs is simple: Turn your talent into passive income. ElevenLabs lets you create an AI clone of your voice and put it to work earning you money.

**Effortless voice cloning:** No more endless studio sessions. just 30 mins of audio lets them build a high-quality AI replica of your voice.

**The Voice Library:** It's like a marketplace where you list your voice clone for others to use in their projects. Voice actors remain the owners of their authentic voices. ElevenLabs has moderation guardrails to prevent misuse of your voice and options for you to customize these filters.

## Why should I care?

Taking away creative jobs is one of the main criticisms today. Artists, photographers, voice actors—everyone hates AI because it can take away their primary source of earning.

With this program, you can think of it like this: your real voice does the client work, and your AI voice handles the side hustle. Long-term effects of AI creating content are hard to get right, but in the meanwhile payout programs like this open up a whole new revenue stream, instead of taking away work.
