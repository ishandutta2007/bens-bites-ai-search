# What's going on with Open AI?

### Real-time compilation of updates from the hottest tech drama this holiday season.

The hottest company in Silicon Valley, the company that promised God-level AGI is providing a drama whose script can only be written by AGI. The last we tuned in, OpenAI Board and staff were at a standoff.

Reports say that the staff got two different explanations, none of which satisfied them. 743 of the ~770 OpenAI employees, including Ilya Sutskever have signed the letter for the board to resign.

**Report: Emmett Shear will leave if the board doesn‚Äôt provide evidence.**

As per an internal memo, there are intense discussions going on between Sam Altman and Adam D'Angelo (Quora‚Äôs CEO who is one of the three members of the OpenAI board).

While the previous updates mentioned Sam could be back as Director of the traditional board, more updates say that only the CEO role is at the centre of the negotiations.

Emmett is now part of the discussions but will not stay as Interim CEO of OpenAI if the board doesn‚Äôt provide evidence of wrongdoing.

*Emmett be like, ‚ÄúGuys, can you be candid in your conversations with me?‚Äù*

**Statement: Satya Nadella talks to the media after hiring Sam Altman into Microsoft.**

On a mini-media tour with [Bloomberg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ut9zcpOEGgc\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=what-s-going-on-with-open-ai), [CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/20/microsoft-ceo-nadella-says-openai-governance-needs-to-change-no-matter-where-altman-ends-up.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=what-s-going-on-with-open-ai) and [Kara Swisher](https://open.spotify.com/episode/4i4lKsKevNSGEUnuu7Jzn6?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=what-s-going-on-with-open-ai), Nadella talked about what went down and what are his plans.

- I‚Äôm not being told about anything about \[what Sam did] (1). Open AI‚Äôs governance needs to change after this ‚Äùevent‚Äù (2).

- There is no OpenAI without Microsoft leaning in to partner in a deep way. We have everything to serve our customers if Open AI disappeared tomorrow (3).

- We are open for Sam and Greg to go back to Open AI, but they‚Äôll keep doing business with Microsoft in any case (1). I‚Äôm open to both options (2).

- We have a place for every OpenAI employee that wants to come to Microsoft. And will keep supporting the ones who choose to stay at OpenAI (3).

In addition, Sam Altman tweeted that both his and Satya‚Äôs priority is to keep OpenAI thriving.

**Report: OpenAI staff got different examples from the board for ‚Äúhis not candid communication‚Äù**

The examples given are:

1. Altman gave two people at OpenAI the same project.

2. Altman gave two board members different opinions about a member of personnel.

The employees are not buying these (evident from the 95% of them being ready to walk if Sam isn't brought back)

**Report: Through the weekend, OpenAI board was scrambling to find a replacement for the just-announced Interim CEO Mira Murati**

As per reports, The Open AI board went to [former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-approached-anthropic-about-merger?rc=bdorru\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=what-s-going-on-with-open-ai) and the co-founder and CEO of Scale AI, Alex Wang. Both of them declined the offer.

Another major (but expected) attempt from the board was contacting [Anthropic for a merger.](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-approached-anthropic-about-merger?rc=bdorru\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=what-s-going-on-with-open-ai) Anthropic was started by ex-OpenAI employees Dario and Daniela Amodei with their concerns about OpenAI‚Äôs approach to safety.

**Monday, 20th November 2023 (11:15 AM ET)**

About 650 of 770 people at Open AI have signed the letter at this moment. As people start waking up, more will come. All the efforts started after 1:30 AM, 500+ within two hours and all of this after 2 crazy days with very little sleep. ‚Äî [Lilian Weng, applied research @OpenAI](https://twitter.com/lilianweng/status/1726634736943280270?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=what-s-going-on-with-open-ai)

Still, no word on what was the board‚Äôs actual reason for starting all of this.

**Monday, 20th November 2023 (8:30 AM ET)**

Ilya Sutskever, the Chief Scientist of OpenAI has had some sort of deep realization. The soldier is back to the home turf and fighting alongside his homies.

The Wired has published a letter signed by 500+ OpenAI employees to the Open AI board, asking their resignation. Ilya Sutskever is among the people who have signed.

The key bits from the letter:

To the Board of Directors at OpenAI:

1. The process of this firing has jeopardised the company. This conduct makes it clear that you are not competent to oversee the company.

2. You‚Äôve not provided any written facts of your allegations and were negotiating in bad faith. Despite the leadership‚Äôs suggestion for the most stabilizing path forward (resignation of the board), you‚Äôve replaced Interim CEO Mira Murati again against the interests of the company.

3. You‚Äôve told us that even destroying the company will be consistent with the mission.

4. \*\*Hence:\*\*Either resign and bring everyone back or we all go with Sam and Greg to work at Microsoft under their new unit. Satya says he‚Äôs happy to help.*(my words, not theirs but they mean the same)*

Ilya Sutskever, the Chief Scientist of OpenAI has had some sort of deep realization. The soldier is back to the home turf and fighting alongside his homies.

Ilya regrets his actions and is willing to do whatever it takes to reunite the company. Sam retweets with hearts (three hearts).

That‚Äôs some homecoming.
