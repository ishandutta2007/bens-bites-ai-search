OpenAI, the AI ‘startup’ behind ChatGPT, is seeking a[new valuation of up to $90 billion](https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openai-seeks-new-valuation-of-up-to-90-billion-in-sale-of-existing-shares-ed6229e0?mod=tech_lead_story\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=what-s-next-for-open-ai).

**What's going on here?**

OpenAI aims to triple its valuation from earlier this year.

**What does this mean?**

OpenAI's valuation is skyrocketing thanks to ChatGPT's popularity and its expected billion-dollar revenue this year. OpenAI is in talks to allow employees to sell existing shares to investors, which could value the company at $80-90 billion—almost triple its earlier $29 billion valuation.

**Why should I care?**

This new valuation triples its previous from earlier this year, making it one of the most valuable global startups.

**How to use AI to get better at email**

If I want AI to help me with one thing, it’s email - getting lost in threads and even finding the right d\*\*n message!

We walk through how you can use AI to help with all of that, using Shortwave.

Shortwave is a new email assistant that uses LLMs extensively. They store all your emails in a vector database so search is much more powerful than the awful experience you’re used to.

[Microsoft is focusing on its plans beyond Open AI](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/how-microsoft-is-trying-to-lessen-its-addiction-to-openai-as-ai-costs-soar?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=newsletter\&utm_campaign=microsoft-s-plans-beyond-open-ai)by directing internal researchers and resources to make smaller models that can take the place of GPT-4 in relevant situations.

**What’s going on here?**

Microsoft wants to build its own advanced AI to reduce costs and dependence on OpenAI.

![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/0e22d25b-42dc-4fb1-a41c-1b7d31658594/02d68d3a-f324-452e-8875-6662599ee2b0.jpeg)

**What does this mean?**

Microsoft is directing its researchers to create conversational AI models that perform nearly as well as OpenAI's but are much smaller and cheaper to run. This in-house AI is already being tested by Microsoft's Bing team for features similar to ChatGPT. Orca and Phi models from Microsoft are likely the results of the same push.

The goal is to save on the ballooning compute costs of large AI models. Even though Microsoft has invested over $10 billion in OpenAI for exclusive access to its tech, unchecked costs from widespread use could get out of hand fast. Smaller "distilled" models that mimic the capabilities of behemoths like GPT-4 can help control expenses while providing customers with powerful AI features.

**Why should I care?**

This gives Microsoft options beyond OpenAI to deliver performant and affordable AI products. It's a smart business move to avoid overreliance on external partners, however fruitful the relationship may be currently. Plus having in-house alternatives puts Microsoft in a better negotiating position with OpenAI down the road.
