Hello folks, here’s what we have today;

##### <mark>**Our picks**</mark>

**1/**

The White House has[seven AI companies to agree to abide by a set of asks on AI safety](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/21/23802274/artificial-intelligence-meta-google-openai-white-house-security-safety?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=white-house-mega-deal-with-ai-companies).These are**Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft**from the big tech, and**Open AI, Inflection, and Anthropic**from the AI front. These\*\*rules are only voluntary,\*\*so there won’t be any actual ramifications of ignoring them.

With the media attention and statements, this feels like they have really started getting the ball rolling on the AI safety and regulation front. Here are some of the official statements:

Google:[Advancing bold and responsible AI](https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/public-policy/our-commitment-to-advancing-bold-and-responsible-ai-together/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=white-house-mega-deal-with-ai-companies)\
Inflection:[The precautionary principle](https://inflection.ai/partnering-with-the-white-house-on-ai-safety?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=white-house-mega-deal-with-ai-companies)\
Open AI:[Moving AI governance forward](https://openai.com/blog/moving-ai-governance-forward?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=white-house-mega-deal-with-ai-companies)\
White House:[Voluntary commitments from leading AI companies](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=white-house-mega-deal-with-ai-companies)

OpenAI is[bringing the ChatGPT mobile app to Android users](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.openai.chatgpt\&hl=en_US\&pli=1). It’s currently on the Play Store, where you can**pre-register for auto-download**when it opens up next week. Personally, the iOS app was a game changer for me. Hope it’ll be the same for Android users.

**3/**

Stability AI is keeping things coming, and this time we’re back on the language model front.[FreeWilly 1 and 2 are their open access LLMs](https://stability.ai/blog/freewilly-large-instruction-fine-tuned-models?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=white-house-mega-deal-with-ai-companies)that they claim to have “exceptional” performance. They both**rely on Meta’s LLaMA foundation**models with a bit of supervised fine-tuning thrown into the mix, and even get to a point of**matching GPT-3.5.**

**4/**

The**Open Source Initiative**says that[Meta’s LLaMa 2 license is not Open Source](https://blog.opensource.org/metas-llama-2-license-is-not-open-source/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=white-house-mega-deal-with-ai-companies). They do praise Meta for making things easy to access but are**salty about Meta calling it open source.**

Here’s another POV about how[LLaMA2 isn't open source](https://www.alessiofanelli.com/blog/llama2-isnt-open-source?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=white-house-mega-deal-with-ai-companies)—and why it doesn't matter. Aleesio’s breakdown of what**different forms open source can take for AI**is interesting.
