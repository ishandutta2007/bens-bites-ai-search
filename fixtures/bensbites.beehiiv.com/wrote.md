### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**OpenAI releases AI vs Human detector for ChatGPT**](https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/)

OpenAI created an incredible tool (ChatGPT) but along came **big problems** (plagiarism, hate speech). And [**they‚Äôve delivered a solution**](https://openai.com/blog/new-ai-classifier-for-indicating-ai-written-text/) (free for now). What a business!

With identifying 26% of AI-written texts as ‚Äúlikely AI,‚Äù they‚Äôve beaten the state-of-the-art in **detecting AI-generated text**. Only 9% of students will get unjustified detention because of false positives, [**as Semafor reports**](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/31/2023/chatgpt-creator-openai-develops-ai-text-detection-tool).

Among many problems, chatbot plagiarism by students has been a major concern. Partially solving that issue is a big step in the right direction, but it's time we evolve education itself by integrating the new tech.

**2/**

**[Artifact - A personalised news feed](https://artifact.news/)[using the latest AI tech](https://artifact.news/).**

The Instagram founders are BAAAAAACKKKK. Kevin and Mike have announced their new project which is promising to be 'TikTok for Text', which sounds....interesting...It's in early access üò© but will be interesting to see it launch.

**3/**

[**Model extracts training data from generative art models**](https://twitter.com/arankomatsuzaki/status/1620241696431935489)

Oh god, it‚Äôs time to drag the AI art lawsuits back up again. This [**paper**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.13188) is *insane* - it manages to extract images from the AI training data that it memorises, and it dredges up a load of stuff, including‚Ä¶ **copyrighted images**. Legal implications are around the corner, whereas the **privacy concern** is smiling from a distance‚Äîstill ignored by all the models in the market.

[**Humans can‚Äôt pay attention to easy tasks for long: use AI accordingly**](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-cnet-fake-news-fiasco-autopilot)

Have you ever sat down to finish some routine paperwork? I bet you just lost interest and watched Netflix instead. Yeah, same. That‚Äôs what tends to happen when humans do repetitive, boring tasks. Now think of us in driverless cars, not actually paying attention to when we might have to assist.

[**Gary Marcus argues**](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-cnet-fake-news-fiasco-autopilot) that it‚Äôs this psychological trait that we need to be very **wary of in our use of AI in its infancy**. CNET is a case in point: they didn‚Äôt check any of the AI articles they published, and most had errors.
