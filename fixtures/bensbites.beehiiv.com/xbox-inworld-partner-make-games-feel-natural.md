This multi-year partnership will mix Inworld's expertise in AI character creation with Microsoft's cloud AI services to bake accessible AI tools for all game creators.

## What does this mean?

The main tools they plan to build are an AI design copilot to turn ideas into detailed game scripts, and a character engine to generate dynamic in-game narratives.

The AI copilot aims to loosen things up so developers can imagine more expansive game worlds and stories. As a helping hand, it will transform high-level creative ideas into detailed dialogue trees, quests, and scripts. Inworld is chatting with narrative designers to shape what the tool can do.

The character engine will conduct multiple AI models to enable characters that dynamically respond to player actions and choices in real time. This brings life to characters in ways not possible before. The focus is expanding what the engine can do and optimizing performance.

## Why should I care?

Immersive storytelling and character involvement in games will likely increase if all goes well. The AI copilot will save developers time, enabling richer game worlds. The character engine will transform gameplay with responsive NPCs.

Dynamic narratives and NPCs have been top requests from gamers. With 99% saying advanced AI will improve games, this partnership responds directly to what players want - more agency through adaptable worlds and characters.
