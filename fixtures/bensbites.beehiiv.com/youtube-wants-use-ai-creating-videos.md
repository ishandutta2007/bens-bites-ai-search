## What does this mean?

YouTube will begin testing Dream Screen later this year, allowing users to generate AI video or image backgrounds by typing prompts. A new mobile editing app called YouTube Create is in beta and offers easy editing tools and effects. Starting next year, YouTube Studio will use AI insights to suggest personalized video ideas, help find music faster, and dub your videos in other languages using Aloud.

## Why should I care?

YouTube is the first major social platform to heavily invest in AI creation tools, staying ahead of competitors. While startups have launched similar AI features, YouTube is uniquely positioned to integrate AI natively while others play catchup. This investment by Youtube shows AI-assisted content creation is going mainstream soon. The new mobile editor will also compete with TikTokâ€™s CapCut which many creators swear by.
