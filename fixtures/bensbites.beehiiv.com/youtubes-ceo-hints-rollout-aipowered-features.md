## What does this mean?

Neal's letter highlights a few key moves, but our focus is on the first one: AI. It isn't just a buzzword at YouTube—with projects like Dream Screen and Dream Music AI Incubator YouTube is pushing the boundaries of what creators can do.

Here’s a recap of [AI features in testing/beta](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/made-on-youtube-product-and-event-photos/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=youtube-s-ceo-hints-at-rollout-of-more-ai-powered-features) on YouTube. We can expect many of these to be available to everyone this year. On the safety front, YouTube will introduce labels to realistic content that is actually synthetic (deepfakes, AI videos, etc.).

## Why should I care?

One silent, but lovely AI feature that YouTube has launched is the AI grouping of comments under videos. I often check them out.

But in Neal letter’s, there’s a great focus on shorts and TV format as the future of YouTube. So, bringing AI into those formats is their highlight. If you create videos on YouTube, you should try to experiment with AI but in these formats, it’s one of those waves in the ecosystem bringing new creators to the mainstream, like YouTube Originals (and gonna be much bigger in my opinion).
