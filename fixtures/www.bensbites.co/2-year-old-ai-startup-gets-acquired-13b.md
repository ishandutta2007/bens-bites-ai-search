Hey folks, today we have the AI startup Mosiac ML being acquired by DataBricks. A huge win for the ecosystem.

Next up, Adobe is taking legal responsibility for Firefly usage, and Open AI might be going heads-on with Microsoft with an office work app with ChatGPT.

Let’s get to it.

[DataBricks acquires MosaicML for enterprise AI models](https://www.mosaicml.com/blog/mosaicml-databricks-generative-ai-for-all?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=2-year-old-ai-startup-gets-acquired-for-1-3b)

Step aside you greedy VCs, it’s time for acquisitions to take centre stage, and**DataBricks**is kicking off the show. They’ve just entered into a whopper of a\*\*$1.3B deal to buy MosaicML\*\*- the startup building platforms for organisations to train their own state-of-the-art language models for deployment. MosaicLM, with just $64M raised, has been making waves already: Their flagship model has 3.3 million downloads, and they’re big on open-source. Can we call this a step in the direction of democratising AI?

[Adobe promise to cover any legal costs of lawsuit issues from Firefly](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/26/adobe-indemnity-clause-designed-to-ease-enterprise-fears-about-ai-generated-art/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=2-year-old-ai-startup-gets-acquired-for-1-3b)

If you’re like me, reading phrases like “indemnity clause” will make your eyes droop and your brain switch off. But trust me on this one, it’s worth knowing about - especially if you wanna be a Firefly enterprise customer. (If you didn’t know, Firefly is Adobe’s AI art generator/editor.)**Adobe**has gone bold (pardon the pun?) and offered to**pay the legal fees of any copyright lawsuits**that come to customers as a result of**Firefly**outputs. That’s actually a massive, and smart move. It simultaneously demonstrates confidence in their ethical sourcing of images for training, and will lure back those customers who were treading nervously.

An interview with Sam Altman earlier this month (which got taken down) mentioned that OpenAI is not looking to compete with its partners. But this report from The Information flips that on its head.

So, Sam hush hush told some developers about the plans of making a super-**work app with ChatGPT, targeting enterprises.**This means**direct conflict with Microsoft**—the money machine for OpenAI and Salesforce—another of its biggest partners.

There is some news on Twitter about Sam getting**interested in AI agents**as well.

[Deepmind CEO - Gemini, Google’s next model after PaLM will eclipse ChatGPT](https://www.wired.com/story/google-deepmind-demis-hassabis-chatgpt/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=2-year-old-ai-startup-gets-acquired-for-1-3b)

It looks like the slow pace of Google’s Bard in the race against ChatGPT has pricked the ears of Google’s buddy**DeepMind**- surely one of the most formidable competitors in a tech race. Watch out OpenAI! Deepmind’s CEO claims that their next model**Gemini**, is gonna be\*\*better than ChatGPT,\*\*and they’re oozing confidence.

They’re building it using a combination of typical LLM tech, and methods used in their\*\*algorithm that beat pro Go players,\*\*they say it’ll advance abilities for language models to solve complex problems and analyse text.
