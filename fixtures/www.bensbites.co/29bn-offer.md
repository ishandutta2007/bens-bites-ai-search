Happy Friday folks! This is Ben's Bites, the daily newsletter that illuminates the world of AI like a futuristic neon sign.

Sorry a little late today. Let's get to it, it's the freaking weekend.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

Let's talk about **[the $29Bn elephant in the room](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-creator-openai-is-in-talks-for-tender-offer-that-would-value-it-at-29-billion-11672949279)**... OpenAI is raising at an eye-watering valuation. It was valued at a $14Bn in 2021. So **2x in 1 year**. Cool, cool, cool.

The deal is being negotiated with Thrive Capital and Founders Fund, and it could total at least **$300 million in share sales**. *(Altman says OpenAI has no plans to be acquired or go public so investors would only be able to cash out through secondary share sales.)*

They're calling it a tender offer (no, not a very sweet, loving offer). It means existing shareholders like employees can sell their shares to the investors.

**NO deal**has been made yet! But I reckon it'll happen any minute now...

A few important things to know/remember:

- OpenAI was founded as a **non-profit but has a for-profit arm**, created in 2019
- Investors **returns are capped at ~20x**
- Sam Altman said they'll make **$1Bn revenue 'soon'**
- This valuation would make it one of the **most valuable startups in the US**

Sam Altman has talked about Trillion dollar companies being made in AI. I think OpenAI will be the first. And at this rate it could be in the next 1-2 years.
