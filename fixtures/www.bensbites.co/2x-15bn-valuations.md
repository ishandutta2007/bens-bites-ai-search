**Two AI companies valued at $1.5 Billion**. [Stability AI](https://twitter.com/erinkwoo/status/1582234609592328192?s=12\&t=ebJDTDuIDUTP0fO6NJeTnw) (makers of Stable Diffusion) and just announced [Jasper](https://twitter.com/DaveRogenmoser/status/1582362508362280960) - writing tool, **raised $101M and $125m**, respectively. These are astronomical numbers! We've hopefully got an interview with Jasper CEO coming this week.

I got access to Lex, the writing tool I talked about yesterday and used it to write this email. Although I don't use any tools to actually write the snippets. So I like it but not using its AI potential yet.

I played around with Play.ht which was behind the fake podcast stunt. **[So you can listen to today's email here](https://play.ht/articles/a2d95f50-830b-4ec3-a41d-ea742a49c82b)**. Shoutout to our fake narrator, Oliver.

Let's get to it.

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

- Image ‚Üí prompt. We‚Äôve all done it the other way around. Now you can [**generate a prompt by feeding it an image**](https://twitter.com/QasimMunye/status/1581784155528232960) (Stable Diffusion). Shout-out to Bens Bites reader [Clayton](https://twitter.com/ClaytonFarr) for surfacing this.

- Comedians Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer have a podcast 2 Bears, 1 Cave and [in their latest episode](https://youtu.be/S_RppOOnfeI?t=1452), **they use AI to generate portraits of each of them**. They‚Äôre pretty funny!

- [**Another tool to help you with generating prompts**](https://twitter.com/MichaelStivala/status/1581999889700962304)! I saw this demo a few days ago and said it should be a product for others to use, and to his credit, Michael got it done. It‚Äôs live and this is what it looks like:

- Runway, the video creation and edition (magic) tool has released: [Erase and Replace](https://twitter.com/runwayml/status/1581996497952206849). It allows you to **swap out images in your video, seamlessly**.

üëã Too many links?! I created a database for all links mentioned in these emails. Refer 2 friends [using this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER) and I'll send over the link database.

- Got an iPhone? **You can now [become a 3D artist](https://twitter.com/LumaLabsAI/status/1582052095124856832)**. LumaLabs (mentioned in past emails) gives you the ability to export your captures as diffuse 3D assets!

- [This article](https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-image-generators-artists-copying-style-thousands-images-2022-10?r=US\&IR=T) has been making the rounds (I should‚Äôve included it in yesterday‚Äôs email, whoops). Essentially the points made are that **Artists say they work for years on their portfolios and now people can now make copycat images in seconds**. But some AI companies argue that the **new artworks are unique and can be copyrighted**. What‚Äôs your take?

- [This thread](https://twitter.com/clemnt/status/1582031407932899328?s=12\&t=yyqJn3iqMnyz8jsxj1gT5w) discusses **different use cases for using AI tools**.

[Related thread](https://twitter.com/lkr/status/1579945483514286080) from people who actually use these products and what they use them for.

- Is [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/y6eth3/is_this_imagination/) imagination? A reddit user created **a character and asked AI to imagine stuff** and wrote how AI could have its own imagination. Related phenomenon - [The AI effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_effect).

- **Another writing tool** that I was linked to - [Moonbeam](https://www.gomoonbeam.com/)

- Imagic: Text-Based Real Image Editing with Diffusion Models. Basically, it can let you **[change the posture and composition](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1582175757153230849?s=12\&t=ebJDTDuIDUTP0fO6NJeTnw) of one or multiple objects inside an image** while preserving its original characteristics.

- DiffLinker is [now on Hugging Face](https://twitter.com/ilvailvail/status/1581999299910864898?s=12\&t=ebJDTDuIDUTP0fO6NJeTnw). Given a set of disconnected fragments in 3D, **it places missing atoms in between and designs a molecule** incorporating all the initial fragments.
