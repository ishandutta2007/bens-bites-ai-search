Hey everyone, and welcome to the 121 new folk joining us since yesterday.

A few of you have asked, so I've created an [AI job board](https://bensbites.pallet.com/jobs) + talent collective. If you're looking for AI job opportunities, **[sign up here](https://bensbites.pallet.com/talent/welcome?application=true\&pallet=\&step=welcome)** (it's free) and I'll match you with companies hiring (you can remain anonymous too). If your company is hiring, you can post jobs and get access to the talent [here](https://bensbites.pallet.com/hire). It's early so expect this to grow over time. Everything is vetted by me.

Let's get into it!

*p.s. I keep forgetting to actually [link the Discord](https://discord.gg/e2eHhdAt) if you're interested.*

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

We got the scoop! Sahil Lavingia (founder of Gumroad) has launched [**Ask My Book**](https://askmybook.com/). It‚Äôs being launched later today but he gave me the all-clear to announce it here first. Sahil wrote a book ‚ÄòThe Minimalist Entrepreneur‚Äô and has built this tool so that you can **ask it any question and it will answer it in real-time, with a voice cloned from Sahil‚Äôs**. It‚Äôs a really impressive way to see how AI tools combined can create a really helpful experience. He‚Äôs [**hosting a webinar on Friday that explains how he built it**](https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/WN_csinzXkQQvCq1BV2nd0mrA).

A [**demo of Game art**](https://twitter.com/bioinfolucas/status/1591878500344303616) made easy - Simple Stable Diffusion to Puppet: Stable diffusion -> concept art -> Automatic Puppet 2d Animation

Universal image segmentation, and how it can be used to [**improve performance across multiple image segmentation tasks**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06220). A truly universal framework should be trained only once and be able to achieve state-of-the-art performance. The OneFormer framework proposed in the article is a step towards making image segmentation more universal and accessible.

The [**next Google search engine will be Generative AI**](https://whilstinarrakis.wordpress.com/2022/11/11/the-next-google-search-engine-will-be-generative-ai/). The current design of search engines is based on outdated technology. AI could be used to create a new type of search engine that is more efficient. But, training a model is expensive.

Sieve raised $4m and launched its AI API Beta. Sieve is a platform that makes it [**easy to process, understand, and search video**](https://www.sievedata.com/blog/launch), and it can be used to create interactive features without setting up a separate backend.

I wrote a little thread on [**simplifying AI terminology**](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1591446546905710596).
