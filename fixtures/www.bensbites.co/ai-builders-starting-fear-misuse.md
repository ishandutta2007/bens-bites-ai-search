Hey folks, today we have some big hits: the Godfather of AI leaves Google, reading people‚Äôs minds, the future of chatbox UI and AI content farms in the wild.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

From our sponsor:

**A Banksy got everyday investors 32% returns?**

*Mm-hmm, sure. So, what‚Äôs the catch?*

We know it may sound too good to be true. But thousands of investors are already smiling all the way to the bank, thanks to the fine-art investing platform Masterworks.

These results aren‚Äôt cherry-picking. This is the whole bushel. Masterworks has built a track record of 13 exits, including net returns of +10.4%, +27.3%, and +35.0%, even while financial markets plummeted.

But art? Really? Okay, skeptics, here are the numbers. Contemporary art prices:

- outpaced the S\&P 500 by 131% over the last 26 years

- have the lowest correlation to equities of any asset class

- remained stable through the dot-com bubble and ‚Äô08 crisis

[The Godfather of AI resigns from Google so he can openly discuss AI safety](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/1/23706311/hinton-godfather-of-ai-threats-fears-warnings?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-godfather-leaves)

For those who don‚Äôt know,**Geoffrey Hinton**is a pretty big deal in the AI world - so much so that he‚Äôs often called the\*\*‚ÄúGodfather‚Äù**of it. So it‚Äôs also a pretty big deal that he‚Äôs just left**Google\*\*, and according to the[NYT‚Äôs article](https://archive.vn/DlNpR?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-godfather-leaves)it‚Äôs because he wants to be able to speak openly about AI dangers without having to think about the impact it‚Äôll have on them. He‚Äôs even gone as far as saying that he‚Äôs beginning to**regret his life‚Äôs work**, because no matter what, the bad actors will get their bad acting done. With the backdrop of concerned critics like Yudkowsky and Gary Marcus, this is quite the headline for a Tuesday.

**Chat interfaces for LLMs - the good, the bad and what‚Äôs beyond**

Let‚Äôs get a bit nerdy today. If you‚Äôre using ChatGPT or other LLMs regularly, you have felt this; a chatbot is not the easiest to interact with. Sometimes, I just want to click a button, or choose from a list, instead of typing the whole thing out.

**So, what‚Äôs wrong with the chatbox UI?** The glove example in [this post from Amelia](https://wattenberger.com/thoughts/boo-chatbots?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-godfather-leaves) (Github R\&D) is **chef‚Äôs kiss. ‚Äú** *The shape and material of a glove tell me how to wear it and what can I do with it. Chatboxes don‚Äôt do that. They don‚Äôt tell me what to give them and what I can expect.‚Äù*

Check [this talk from Linus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd-J3hmycQs\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-godfather-leaves) (from Notion AI), where he goes deeper into discussing the technical bits of **creating user interfaces beyond chat** for interacting with AI.

[Researchers use fMRI and language models to read people‚Äôs minds](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a3w3g/scientists-use-gpt-ai-to-passively-read-peoples-thoughts-in-breakthrough?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-godfather-leaves)

Wow, this is some serious futuristic Black Mirror type stuff - so much so that it‚Äôs almost hard to believe! Using a combination of**fMRI**scans and**GPT tech**, researchers have shown patients a film, and managed to decode the general idea of what the film is about. I mean that is pretty damn crazy, effectively**reading someone‚Äôs mind**! The model was trained to associate fMRI scan activity with known video/audio content, and then use that understanding to look at an fMRI scan and understand what the people were watching or listening to. Beyond the scary Black Mirror stuff, this could one day be used to help people with disabilities communicate - lovely stuff!
