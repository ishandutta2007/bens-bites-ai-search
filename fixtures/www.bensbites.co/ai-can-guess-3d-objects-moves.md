Hey everyone! Wow, I'm genuinely stuck with what to say here today. I wanted to make a Turkey/Thanksgiving reference, a joke, even. But I just kept drawing a blank. So instead of stuffing anything in here, let's get to it.

üòè

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- Meta AI presents CICERO ‚Äî the first AI to achieve human-level performance in Diplomacy, a strategy game. Basically, **AI strategically plans world conquest, negotiating with humans and then betraying them**. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. AI is just a toy, right?! ([link](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people/))
- I like pretty much anything Steph Smith does, so it‚Äôs no surprise that her podcast interview **‚ÄúThe Future Of A.I. Businesses With Steph Smith‚Äù** is something I recommend listening to/watching. She is always on top of trends and interesting opportunities. Steph is a podcast host at a16z and talks about **bringing AI into the workflow** (see, there‚Äôs a theme with smart people - work WITH the tools). My personal opinion is that using AI for \[insert anything here] is basically like a designer using Photoshop. It‚Äôs a tool to get a better output than you could without it. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-ye-C-XSzk\&t=100s))
- MagicPony learns a function that can **estimate the 3D shape, articulation, viewpoint, texture, and lighting of an articulated animal like a horse, given a single test image**. The method is trained purely from in-the-wild single-view images of the object category, with minimal assumptions about the topology of deformation. ([link](https://3dmagicpony.github.io/))

### **üî¨ Research**

- A new approach to **3D inpainting** that addresses the challenges of view consistency and geometric validity. The proposed method uses a perceptual optimization-based approach that leverages learned 2D image inpainters. ([link](https://spinnerf3d.github.io/))
- HyperTuning uses a hypermodel to **generate task-specific parameters** for a fixed downstream model. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12485))
- Never Ending Visual-classification Stream (NEVIS'22) is a benchmark consisting of a stream of **over 100 visual classification tasks**. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11747))
- ConCoRD can be used to **boost the consistency and accuracy of pre-trained NLP models**. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11875))
- Exact Diffusion Inversion via Coupled Transformations (EDICT) is a new method for **inverting denoising diffusion models (DDMs) to produce an input image from a noise vector**. It is more stable than the state-of-the-art approach, which is based on local linearization assumptions. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12446))
- SinDiffusion is a method for **generating photorealistic and diverse images from a single image**. The method is based on two core designs: training with a single model at a single scale, and identifying that a patch-level receptive field of the diffusion network is crucial and effective for capturing the image's patch statistics. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12445))
- A new **text-to-image benchmark** that contains a suite of thirty-two tasks over multiple applications that capture a model's ability to handle different features of a text prompt. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.12112))
- Videogenic - **extracting highlight moments out of videos** by converting long-form videos into engaging short-form highlights. ([link](https://chuanenlin.com/videogenic/))

- DiffDreamer - **generating long-range novel views**. The DiffDreamer framework is unsupervised and is able to synthesize views depicting a long camera trajectory while only training on internet-collected images of nature scenes. ([link](https://primecai.github.io/diffdreamer))
- Real-time **synthesizing of talking portraits**. ([link](https://me.kiui.moe/radnerf/))
- EVA is the first **open-sourced billion-scale vision foundation** model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on a broad range of downstream tasks. ([link](https://huggingface.co/BAAI/EVA))

### **ü§ì Everything else**

- Hugging Face recently added materials to their **Depth Estimation** task. Depth estimation is the task of predicting the depth of the objects present in an image. ([link](https://huggingface.co/tasks/depth-estimation))
- I put together **a thread of the best AI threads** I‚Äôve found on Twitter. Yeah, it‚Äôs meta. ([link](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1595070420155342850))
- **A generative AI prototype for 3D models** and scenes built in 2 weeks using only 8,000 models. There‚Äôs a huge need for 3D generation but there are also problems to overcome. Physna, a 3D search and analysis company, did this research to push the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible. ([link](https://medium.com/@pauljoeypowers/creating-equitable-3d-generative-ai-c7b9947cba69))
- It looks like folks are moving to their own **custom models using Replicate** from Astria. ([link](https://twitter.com/dannypostmaa/status/1594999942590115840))
- There‚Äôs been a lot of chatter about Galactica, Meta‚Äôs scientific search + generation tool. And we all love reading Alberto‚Äôs takes don‚Äôt we (he wrote about GPT-4 rumours). So here‚Äôs his **not-so-hot take on Galactica**. ([link](https://thealgorithmicbridge.substack.com/p/galactica-what-dangerous-ai-looks)). Personally, I think these tools shouldn‚Äôt be taken as fact, but we need to be able to play and push these things when they come out. Luckily **Emad, from StabilityAI, is looking to release an open-source version**. ([link](https://twitter.com/emostaque/status/1594998355997900801)) Never a dull day in AI!
- Categories for AI talk: **Causal model abstraction & grounding via category theory** - by Taco Cohen ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mZhcXhbciE))
- Discoo Diffusion - Personalized Stable Diffusion with few-shot fine-tuning, create your own Stable Diffusion on a single CPU. ([link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Intel/dicoo_diffusion))
