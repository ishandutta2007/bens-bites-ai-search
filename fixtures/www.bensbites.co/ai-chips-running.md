# AI chips are running out

### PLUS: LLMs outside the US, new ways to use GPT

Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got state of AI chips that run these models: Nvidia is trying harder, and Intel is experimenting, but do we have enough?

Naver (the South Korean search engine) is targeting other countries with a promise of localised LLMs. Also, Azure is giving prompting tips to biz owners using their platform.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[**South Korea‚Äôs Naver to target foreign governments with latest ChatGPT-like AI model**](https://www.ft.com/content/8c9a2842-ff01-46aa-a82b-1b46342264f6?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-chips-are-running-out)

While Microsoft and Google are playing the universal AI game, Naver is going down a different path. If you don‚Äôt know, Naver is the go-to search engine in South Korea, with more than 2/3rd of the users using it.

Their new ChatGPT-like systems are all about localised AI applications, focusing on countries with political sensitivities in the Arab world, and non-English speaking countries like Spain and Mexico.

This is a pretty savvy move if you ask me... Governments in these places are itching to have their own AI systems, ones that are tailor-made to their political and cultural contexts (and outside the US data control). For them, it could be a perfect fit, baby!

[The AI boom runs on chips, but it can‚Äôt get enough.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-ai-boom-runs-on-chips-but-it-cant-get-enough-9f76f554?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-chips-are-running-out)

You need the pan to make a pancake, and in the AI kitchen, that we are running out of pans, aka the chips. Nvidia is the primary maker of these chips. They are trying to make more and better ones, but the demand is too high. This has left everyone, especially the **smaller AI startups, scrambling for resources**(or begging cloud giants for more rental space). WSJ article [without paywall](https://archive.vn/BjVRX?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-chips-are-running-out).

So, what's the fix? I wish I had the answer, folks, but this one's got even the top brass scratching their heads. Could that be Intel? They are working on VPUs, which they claim can **sustain and offload the AI burden** on CPUs, GPUs, and clouds. [More on that here.](https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/29/vpus_all_meteork_lake_skus/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-chips-are-running-out) One thing's for sure‚Äîwhoever comes up with a solution is going to be sitting pretty!

[**AI NPCs react to natural language in game.**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/28/23740908/nvidia-ace-demo-voice-ai-npc-game-characters?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-chips-are-running-out)

I‚Äôm a sucker for good dialogue in cutscenes in story games but they are rare. And it‚Äôs **kinda boring to press E to interact with the character,** then listen them ramble on with poor dialogue. But hold onto your joysticks, gamers, because Nvidia is cooking up a new suite of features for just that.

That's right, folks, we're talking about a real back-and-forth, heart-to-heart with your digital buddies. Imagine a future where you hold down a button, speak your truth, and get a response drafted by AI. These are **custom responses based on your dialogue** in the side characters‚Äô voices that can tell you more stories, and unlock new missions, and much more. This will take story games to the**next level of player-content interaction.**
