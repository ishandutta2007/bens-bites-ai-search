Hey folks, this has been the biggest week in AI so far (and we‚Äôve had huge ones before)!

Today we‚Äôve got Microsoft adding AI to their set of workplace tools, Zapier‚Äôs natural language API, Apple‚Äôs Siri updates and AI as your CTO.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

[Microsoft integrates generative AI into their tech with the 365 Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/)

**Microsoft**continues unabated in their lead against competitors in the AI race, and they‚Äôre really going for it with the announcement of the**Microsoft 365 Copilot**. OK, the[announcement video](https://news.microsoft.com/reinventing-productivity/)is pretty cringe and contained way too much of the word ‚Äúdrudgery‚Äù, but I low-key loved it. The Copilot tools will**integrate generative AI technology**into aspects of their 365 apps - Word, Excel, Powerpoint, Teams, and more‚Ä¶ You‚Äôll be able to use**text generation in word**, analyse contents of Excel sheets and follow-up with prompt-based questions, and**create Powerpoint slides**too. It looks to me like the AI will even be able to use the contents of your OneDrive to enhance the outputs, but don‚Äôt quote me on that! More detail on[this blog from Microsoft.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/03/16/introducing-microsoft-365-copilot-a-whole-new-way-to-work/)

[Zapier‚Äôs Natural Language Actions make LLM APIs way easier to use](https://zapier.com/l/natural-language-actions)

Let‚Äôs be honest, getting the most out of all these natural language models isn‚Äôt*really*as accessible as everyone says it is - all the API authorisations, the API calls, and the generation of outputs can be a real pain in the bum. The team at**Zapier**have been working around the clock to pull together their[Natural Language Actions](https://twitter.com/mikeknoop/status/1636387943211491328)**(NLA) API**, which essentially uses LLMs to make LLM APIs easier to use. Super nifty stuff!

Zapier‚Äôs 5k+ apps and 20k+ actions are all available, and all*their*API requires is a cheeky language instructions field. Looking beyond this, it‚Äôs even been[integrated into](https://twitter.com/hwchase17/status/1636383376633651203)the**LangChain package**, allowing you to use just a few lines of code to generate a Zapier Toolkit to get hold of Zapier‚Äôs actions right inside your code.

**3/**

[Apple testing new Siri natural language generating features starting with latest tvOS update](https://9to5mac.com/2023/03/16/apple-testing-siri-natural-language-generating-chatgpt/)

Apple's putting Siri through a linguistic workout with their **new natural language generation tech**, codenamed "Bobcat." So far, it's flexing its joke-telling muscles on Apple TV's tvOS 16.4 beta, with plans to roll it out to other Apple gadgets later. This ain't your mama's ChatGPT chatbot; Apple's focused on **upgrading Siri's template-based system** for a more fluent, less clunky experience. As for when this witty word wizardry will spread its wings beyond Apple TV, the timeline remains a mystery.

**4/**

[ChatGPT Chrome extension to use generative AI in any web text boxes](https://twitter.com/ihorstefurak/status/1636460060099371008)

If you need any evidence that ChatGPT is able to turn inexperienced coders into those who can produce an awesome Chrome extension, then look no further. (Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs*self-proclaimed*inexperience, check the thread.) This chap used**ChatGPT**as a guide to building a**Chrome extension**that allows you to insert prompt responses into‚Ä¶ basically anything? It seems to live inside the text boxes of any websites you visit, and all you need to do is start it off with ‚Äú/ai‚Äù, follow up with a prompt, and out comes a response. I love this. It‚Äôs a true demonstration of a cool home project by someone who claims to lack expertise, producing something that looks really useful. Let‚Äôs wait to see how it holds up in practice!

**5/**

Bonus pick: yesterday‚Äôs Stripe announcement with OpenAI is worth mentioning again.[OpenAI partners with Stripe for seamless ChatGPT and DALL¬∑E payments](https://stripe.com/en-gb/newsroom/news/stripe-and-openai). Stripe worked on GPT-3 powered support last year and now integrating GPT-4, the first output is in Stripe Docs.

**(Sponsor) Riverside FM has just launched**\*\*[AI transcriptions](https://bit.ly/AITranscriptionsbyRiverside)\*\*alongside their awesome studio-quality podcast and video recording software.

What‚Äôs even more amazing: it offers**unlimited AI transcriptions for free.**

‚Üí available in over 100 languages\
‚Üí no sign-up is required\
‚Üí it‚Äôs built on Whisper by OpenAI (unmatched accuracy)

Use the AI transcription by Riverside as subtitles, show notes, or first drafts for blog posts**without wasting additional time.**
