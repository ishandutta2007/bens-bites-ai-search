welcome welcome! and Bienvenue to the 161 new folks joining since yesterday.

I need to work on my process a bit as it's getting a little longer to get these out - I'm like the cook in the back being shouted at for not having my prep work on time. Idiot sandwich anyone ü•™. At some point soon I'll switch on a proper domain to make this look all proper. If you've got any feedback or suggestions on what I'm up to, please let me know.

Let's get to it, you can also [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/e2eHhdAt) if you want.

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

Midjourney v4 is awesome, but, it‚Äôs pricey too. So PromptHero built a tool for [**Stable Diffusion fine-tuned on Midjourney v4 images**](https://huggingface.co/prompthero/midjourney-v4-diffusion).

[**An interview (podcast + written) with Dylan Field**](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/8/23445821/figma-adobe-acquisition-design-vr-ai-meta), (a BB sub too üëã), where he talks about the Figma acquisition (obviously) but he also talks about AI at the end. Here are some notes I took from it :

*- There is a lot of hype around AI at the moment, which may lead to a bubble.\
\- AI could be deflationary, as it may make many existing jobs obsolete\
\- Inspiration can be drawn from lots of places. How do you work with an AI agent versus an AI agent replacing a designer?\
\- The bear case is what we have now in AI. If we can take that and just apply it to new areas of the economy, that is already going to be very disruptive.*

p.s. we should totally do our interview, right? - Dylan, are you up for it?

I stopped including the different **Diffusion models** as they are so many now, but, [for this **paper-cutting model**](https://huggingface.co/Fictiverse/Stable_Diffusion_PaperCut_Model), I‚Äôll make an exception.

üëã Too many links?! I created a database for all links mentioned in these emails. Refer 1 friend [using this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER) and I'll send over the link database.

[**Stable-Diffusion with DPM-Solver**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/LuChengTHU/dpmsolver_sdm)can generate high-quality samples by diffusion models within only 10-25 steps.

[**SEScore**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/xu1998hz/sescore) - a **reference-based text-generation evaluation metric** that requires no pre-human-annotated error data.

Runway introduced Text to Color Grade - [**Use natural language to colour grade your videos**](https://twitter.com/runwayml/status/1589980499560103936).

[**Hugging Face‚Äôs store**](https://store.huggingface.co/) is now open!

Twitter has had a search problem forever, you can‚Äôt find anything! Luckily Kiril built a [**semantic search for Twitter**](https://twitter.com/krlvi/status/1590015931677577216), after seeing the ebook search tool.

**AI Assistants that talk like a human** - [Quickchat](https://www.quickchat.ai/)

DeepMind released [TAP-Vid](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03726), a new benchmark for **tracking any point in videos**.

[**Deploy a Gradio app to Spaces from a notebook**](https://nbdev.fast.ai/blog/posts/2022-11-07-spaces/) without having to refactor your code into a script (which Hugging Face currently requires you to do).

[**Why generative AI for music is harder than images**](https://twitter.com/cheriehu42/status/1590006092779905024?s=12\&t=yW5vTGAmyCsaBcchzEWryQ)‚Ä¶TL;DR - training and it‚Äôs not visual!

This magician has been conjuring up [**AI-generated potions on Twitter.**](https://twitter.com/emmanuel_2m/status/1589995198289182720?s=12\&t=ijtqQpVc7664Wq5mCONhgw)

ReAct by Google - a combo of reasoning and acting advances that [**enable language models to solve various language reasoning and decision-making tasks**](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting.html).

[**A sneak peek at Capsule's new tool that magically adds b-roll to videos**](https://twitter.com/doyouknowchamp/status/1590044118637346817). How does it work? An ASR model transcribes your video into text THEN a diffusion model generates images from text AND THEN Capsule's video markup language automates editing the video right inside your browser. No apps needed. Video-to-Text-to-Video üòÖ.

I asked for this on Twitter! A simple AI-terminology breakdown. AssemblyAI wrote [**an explanation of 10 AI terms you should know**](https://twitter.com/assemblyai/status/1590009488408735744?s=12\&t=fCDdvFEXqCw17fWx8qEtNw) (in plain English).

Contrastive search can generate human-level text using off-the-shelf language models across 16 languages. [**Generating human-level text with contrastive search**](https://huggingface.co/blog/introducing-csearch) in Transformers. [A demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/joaogante/contrastive_search_generation) that directly compares contrastive search with other popular decoding methods.

[**A physics-based method for assembling physical items**](http://assembly.csail.mit.edu/). Think manufacturing, 3D objects, product assembly, recycling etc.

[Mysteries of mode collapse due to RLHF](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/t9svvNPNmFf5Qa3TA/mysteries-of-mode-collapse-due-to-rlhf) is a pretty interesting read, but a little technical. So here‚Äôs Ben‚Äôs Bitesize Summary:

It discusses**mode collapse in GPT models that have undergone RLHF** (reinforcement learning from human feedback) training.

Key takeaways:

1. Mode collapse is a phenomenon where the model produces very similar responses to similar prompts.
2. Mode collapse can happen out of distribution, meaning that the model can produce the same responses even when the prompts are very different from what the model was trained on.
3. The reason for mode collapse is not fully understood, but it may be due to the model overfitting to patterns present in the training data.

[Self-conditioned Embedding Diffusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04236v1), a continuous diffusion mechanism that allows for the **flexible and scalable learning of diffusion models** for both conditional and unconditional text generation.

A method for [**removing artificial reverb from music**](https://koichi-saito-sony.github.io/unsupervised-vocal-dereverb/)without requiring pairs of data for training.
