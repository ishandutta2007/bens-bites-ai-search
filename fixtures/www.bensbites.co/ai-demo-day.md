*I'm Ben's Bites, the AI email\
Sending out tasty treats for real\
No need for a chef or a cook\
I've got all the recipes in my book*

Just the ladies:

*Ben's Bites, Ben's Bites\
Sending out the yummiest delights\
Ben's Bites, Ben's Bites\
Always fresh, always right*

Just the robots:

*From breakfast to dinner, I've got it all\
Bagels, pancakes, even a meatball\
You don't have to worry about what to eat\
Just open up Ben's Bites, it's a treat*

Everybody:

*Subscribe now, it's easy and quick\
You'll never have to worry about what to pick\
Just sit back and let me do the work\
Ben's Bites, the best AI email, don't be a jerk*

\*Wait for standing ovation and clapping to finish\*

On to the email.
