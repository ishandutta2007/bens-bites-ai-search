Hey folks! I've got one thing on my (Ben's Bites specific) Xmas list...

I'm looking for any way that this email has helped you in your job, for your company (getting users, investor interest etc), or otherwise. Reason I'm asking is that I'm trying to put together a Ben's Bites Year-in-Review (although we've only been around a couple of months!) Just reply here üòä

The hackathon is in full swing and lots of projects are being talked about [in Discord](https://discord.gg/qd92NKjDdE) and submitted on our [Hackathon page](http://hackathon.bensbites.co/). All you need to do is [sign up on this page to submit](http://hackathon.bensbites.co/) your entry.

We've got **$27k to give away** and some awesome judges from StabilityAI/OSV, Hugging Face, Balderton Capital, Susa Ventures, and individuals like Sahil Lavingia, Anne-Laure Le Cunff, Hiten Shah, Julia Lipton and Courtney Gertin.
