Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got the Japanese government looking at integrating ChatGPT, Autonomous AI agents are changing the game, and a personal agent in your glasses.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[The Japanese govt is considering integrating ChatGPT into their services](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/10/japan-government-weighs-ai-adoption-as-sam-altman-visits-pm-kishida.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-goes-for-tokyo-drift)

Who needs Italians when you can get the Japanese on board? That seems to be the thinking of**OpenAI**following the whole Italy ChatGPT ban, and it might see**Japan**driving the first proper integration of AI into their day-to-day country ops. OpenAI is considering opening an office on the East Asian island, and following a trip from Sam Altman the**Japanese PM**seems to have his interest peaked. He‚Äôs considering using OpenAI to**integrate ChatGPT tech**into their services. With my constant frustration at the UK government‚Äôs 90s-era technology, I have just one question: When are you gonna get involved Rishi?

[Autonomous AI could be about to transform the landscape of alignment research](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dcoxvEhAfYcov2LA6/agentized-llms-will-change-the-alignment-landscape?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-goes-for-tokyo-drift)

Watching an autonomous ChatGPT bot zoom around prompting itself to find the best way to[destroy humanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g7YJIpkk7KM\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ai-goes-for-tokyo-drift)is actually*really kinda spooky*. For those who don‚Äôt know, this new craze of\*\*‚Äúautonomous AIs‚Äù\*\*are ones that iteratively prompts ChatGPT-style tech, executing subtasks to work towards an end goal, and assessing subtask effectiveness as they march forward.

This Less Wrong post throws around some interesting thoughts on them. They are**fanning the sparks of AGI**, behaving in a way that is actually very similar to the human cognitive problem-solving process. Integrating them with models that apply self-improvement of language models, could get rapidly more powerful as we approach the**possibility of real-life AGIs**. If people can potentially give it malicious tasks to solve with a seemingly infinite amount of determinism, then it may end up necessitating far more**enhanced global monitoring**of online behaviour.

[Weekend project putting a personal AI agent inside your smart glasses](https://twitter.com/bryanhpchiang/status/1645501260827885568)

**Warning:**Clicking the link above will lead to a cringe-worthy demo, but a personal project that is damn cool and super impressiveüòÇ. This guy has put together a**personal AI agent**that is delivered through**augmented reality smart glasses**- it recognises your friend‚Äôs faces, hooks up to your texts with them, and suggests things to talk about. Judging by that demo video these aren‚Äôt gaining popularity any time soon, but my head is thinking of future use cases for people with Alzheimer‚Äôs, memory difficulties, and disabilities. Early days, but nice work!

**4/**

[Autonomous AI agents in a simulated town were more human than humans](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1645499660402925576)

We don‚Äôt usually do picks on new research papers, but when it‚Äôs the Sims game on autonomous AI steroids it‚Äôs both relevant and nostalgic - I can‚Äôt resist this one! Researchers put 25**autonomous ChatGPT-style agents**into a**simulated town**with motivations to see if they would engage in human-like behaviour, and*they really did*. In fact, they did it so much that they scored higher on**human likeness**than humans! They were able to both reflect on their memories, as well as reflect upon reflections of memories, make human event plans, and all sorts.
