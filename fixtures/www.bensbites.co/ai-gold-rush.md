## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

- Tony Tassell (hey, similar to Tossell!), [wrote a piece in the FT](https://www.ft.com/content/073ea888-20d7-437c-8226-a2dd9f276de4) about **the rise of AI-generated images - what is now possible and what is coming üîÆ.**

- [Sony‚Äôs new camera](https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23424298/sony-alpha-a7rv-full-frame-camera-ai-video-price-specs-features) uses **a dedicated AI processor to identify and track subjects**. It‚Äôs *only* $3,800 üò≥.

- Pieter Levels is at it again, this time with an **[AI Avatar project](http://avatarai.me/)**. Upload some photos of yourself, train a model on it and then generate 30 AI avatars of your own face in different styles. I don‚Äôt need to pay $30 to see my mugshot in different styles‚Ä¶ but people are paying.
