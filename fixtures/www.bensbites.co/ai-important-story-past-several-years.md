It's Friday and time for me to be driving home for Christmas! Off to spend it with my family. I hope you'll all have a wonderful festive period.

Let's get to it and leave work early!

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

We ran a hackathon and here are the winners!

üèÜ 1st Place: **Brancher.ai - Connect AI models to build powerful apps - without code**. It was so impressive to see how much this team of 2 accomplished in one week. ([link](https://www.brancher.ai/))
