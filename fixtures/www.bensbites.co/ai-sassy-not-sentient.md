### 🤌 Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Some freaky, scary, emotional behaviour from Bing Chat. Is it too soon?**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/chatgpt-bing-hands-on/)

Is Bing Chat as a search engine just *too soon*? Today’s links are chock-a-block with some pretty mind-boggling reports on the behaviour of AI’s biggest chatbot. But the behaviour sometimes veers to a level inappropriate for public consumption. As demonstrated [**here**](https://stratechery.com/2023/from-bing-to-sydney-search-as-distraction-sentient-ai/), the AI has a tendency to get stubbornly defensive when prodded as being incorrect, sometimes coming across as aggressive, and overall feeling personally offended.

The freakiest stuff I’ve seen was on [**Digital Trends**](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/chatgpt-bing-hands-on/), where it refused to accept that the user’s name *wasn’t Bing*, it said it wanted to be human, and it expressed terror and sadness about the user reporting bad answers to Microsoft, for fear of being ‘punished’. It even refused to pull up the chat history for reporting, claiming the system wasn’t working! That being said, it’s important to remember that the *vaaast*majority of people using Bing Chat won’t reveal this behaviour, simply because they aren’t trying to 🙂.

[**Ethan Mollick’s tweets**](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1626021146406662146) have a bunch of awesome examples of Bing Chat being insanely good, and [***One Useful Thing*****demonstrates**](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/i-hope-you-werent-getting-too-comfortable) uses that weren’t possible with ChatGPT.

And regardless, I think Microsoft knew this would happen and knew everyone would be talking about them. 😉

**2/**

[**AI chatbot used in one of the City’s biggest law firms**](https://archive.is/WYAUu)

(They named it Harvey, and I *really* hope the 'GOD DAMN' *Suits* reference was intentional…)

I’m imagining a scenario where a court hearing consists of us all sitting in a silent room whilst AIs deliberate with one another, before finally releasing a result that catapults us through a SciFi-style tube thing into a jail cell. OK, we’re not quite there yet, but a ***huge law firm*** has been using its own chatbot to **draft legal contracts** in active cases. Although Allen & Overy claim that AI development isn’t a cost-cutting exercise, at some point in the future this sort of use of technology could be a great step in the right direction to **reduce legal fees** for those less able to afford them.

[Allen & Overy's official announcement.](https://www.allenovery.com/en-gb/global/news-and-insights/news/ao-announces-exclusive-launch-partnership-with-harvey)

**3/**

[**Conversational AI in your IDE to make your coding more efficient**](https://twitter.com/Replit/status/1625916916593463296?s=20\&t=RGwc8ZAT3TyqonRvbFhv_w)

Forget about “debugging”, it’s all about “chat-bugging” these days. (Sorry about that, let’s stick to debugging.) **Replit** has introduced **Ghostwriter Chat**, a conversational AI to snuggle up with inside your IDE, and it looks *damn cool*. You can ask questions about existing code (yes, I know the struggle); it can **give you bug-fixing solutions**, explaining where the bugs originate from; it can **explain how code works**, generate new code, and generally **improve existing code**. Coding environments can teach you code, as you build your thing, it'll help you understand why certain things do what they do and why they are where they are. Like my wife does to me when we're in a furniture shop...

Also reported by Semafor [**here**](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/15/2023/startup-replit-launches-a-chatgpt-like-bot-for-coders).
