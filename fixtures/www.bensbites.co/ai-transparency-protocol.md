Hey folks, a lot of highlights today. Snapchat released its own AI chatbot, an insightful thread around OpenAI‚Äôs foundry pricing (ahem $1.5m/yr), Anthropic rolling out to startups, AI transparency protocol, Meta adding AI to WhatsApp, Facebook and Insta plus Elon Musk is recruiting AI researchers to compete against OpenAI‚Äîa company he was a co-founder of.

Yeh, let‚Äôs just get to it, shall we?

**1/**[Snapchat released an in-app chatbot called My AI](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/27/23614959/snapchat-my-ai-chatbot-chatgpt-openai-plus-subscription)

**Snapchat**is bringing chatbot AI to the cool kids on the block, with an announcement that they‚Äôre rolling out an in-app chatbot called**My AI**. (My assumption of ‚Äúcool‚Äù is based on the fact that everyone about 10 years younger than me seems to use it‚Ä¶) The Snapchat chatbot will act more like a contact in the app, with its own avatar and the ability to converse with it when you like. Given the**young user base**of Snapchat, it‚Äôs important that this AI is extensively regulated, and they‚Äôre off to the right start: it does indeed have strong personality constraints, refuses to answer homework questions, and is extra careful around politics.

**2/**[OpenAI‚Äôs leaked Foundry pricing - an insightful thread](https://twitter.com/labenz/status/1630284912853917697?s=12\&t=BPoebVzWzbAIu-BGrIQS4g)

**Foundry**, OpenAI‚Äôs upcoming platform for **AI model training**, has just had its pricing scheme leaked. And now we can see where **Microsoft** might start clawing that $10billy back: Model instances range from $250k/year to $1.5m/year! The mega-thread in the link above will give you the full low-down, but overall the platform is there to provide **robust fine-tuning options**, and *might* be using **GPT-4**‚Ä¶ This is a big step, giving capital-backed companies the chance to really develop/tune their own tools to their own domains, which will be great for adoption and value. Furthermore, a push to in-house fine-tuning might be a **move towards reducing hallucinations** as we build an ecosystem of expert AI machines.

**3/**[Anthropic begin supplying generative AI to start-ups](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/27/anthropic-begins-supplying-its-text-generating-ai-models-to-startups/)

**Anthropic**- the ex-OpenAI team with a chatbot called**Claude**- has reportedly begun to make their AI available to a select number of start-ups. It‚Äôs not exactly\*news,\*as Quora were open about including Anthropic models in their Poe technology a while back. But the extra reports suggest they might be stepping back from their**so-far coy approach**to AI development. Given that their tech has made claims to**improve on many aspects of OpenAI‚Äôs**, this is an intriguing and welcome step that I‚Äôm excited to follow‚Ä¶ But is it just because investors are piling on the pressure? Let‚Äôs not forget Google has a $300m stake.

**4/**[OpenAI, TikTok, and others sign up for AI transparency protocol](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/27/1069166/how-to-create-release-and-share-generative-ai-responsibly/)

I‚Äôve had an unusually large desire of late to see strong progress on**regulation**and care in the world of AI development, and OpenAI‚Äôs report we shared a few days ago accelerated that further. Kinda feels like we‚Äôre all tripping over ourselves and maybe need some slowing down! The**Partnership on AI**(PAI), with more than 50 large member organisations, have put together an**AI transparency protocol**following extensive consultation, and some big players have signed up - OpenAI, TikTok, the BBC, and more. It‚Äôs designed to**protect the consumer**to ensure that people know when they‚Äôre interacting with AIs, as well as providing clarity about abilities and drawbacks. When large companies sign up for these sorts of things, landscapes can get poised to shift‚Ä¶

A few more (a lot of stuff to highlight today):

- **Meta revamps**AI unit to get generative tech into products. ([link](https://www.axios.com/2023/02/27/meta-generative-ai-products))

- **Elon Musk is recruiting AI researchers to create an alternative to OpenAI's ChatGPT** (Musk was one of the original co-founders of OpenAI). The goal of the project is to produce more trustworthy and reliable responses, but there is no concrete plan yet. Musk has previously criticized political correctness and 'woke' culture, and his new project could be part of Twitter or a standalone lab.

**Have you checked out** **[Content at Scale??](https://contentatscale.ai/?utm_source=newsletter\&utm_medium=email\&utm_campaign=bensbytes)** **(Sponsor)**

With this new technology, you can upload a list of up to 100 keywords and within minutes, get 100 entire blog posts (2,600+ words!) written. It's so human-like it's actually not AI detectable, saving you against future Google updates and no more waiting around or wasting time on copywriting yourself.

It's not one of these regular AI writers, [definitely worth checking out.](https://contentatscale.ai/?utm_source=newsletter\&utm_medium=email\&utm_campaign=bensbytes)
