Hello and welcome to Ben's Bites - holding your hand as you step towards our AI robot overlords.

Let's get to it.

ps. I built a [super simple AI coach workflow](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1625596005902327808?s=20\&t=_1CkEv2aLWM1S45OCunFcQ) that you can copy.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Jasper roll out a new AI tool for business productivity**](https://twitter.com/heyjasperai/status/1625568513925517325?s=12\&t=e-fiskwzMBVWacAGXKXnRw)

Generative AI tools for **business productivity** are starting to get rolled out as quickly (and energetically) as I rolled into McDonalds on my own for Valentine's dinner last night. The latest to hit the headlines is [**Jasper‚Äôs new business assistant**](https://www.jasper.ai/business): it looks *pretty damn awesome* and has a very Teamsy vibe, which I think we all like, right? You can specify your company‚Äôs ‚Äòvoice‚Äô (bio, product overview, target audience etc), share the Jasper-generated content collaboratively, and even generate emails from a prompt targeted at specific colleagues.

I‚Äôm getting the feeling right now that generative AI is really gonna start taking over day-to-day business. There‚Äôs just so much wasteful rubbish that goes on every day and AI entrepreneurs are pouncing all over it, and effective users are going to love it.

**2/**

[**An autonomous F-16 fighter jet and Eric Schmidt‚Äôs military involvement**](https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7zakb/ai-has-successfully-piloted-a-us-f-16-fighter-jet-darpa-says)

Well, we were going to have to step back from the usual up-beat tone in order to mention AI-in-war eventually. And this week several stories have hit the bill on the role of our wonderful tech in the **military**. Vice reported that DARPA has been able to control an **F-16 jet autonomously** with AI, a huge step in US military development after billions have been directed in that direction. They say the jets won‚Äôt be on their own, but will assist pilots in combat.

Going beyond recent advances, [**Wired published**](https://www.wired.com/story/eric-schmidt-is-building-the-perfect-ai-war-fighting-machine/) an interesting long read on the ex-Google CEO‚Äôs curious involvement with the army. Eric Schmidt talks about some kind of digital twins of manufactured equipment that can be tested in the Metaverse (which I‚Äôm totally clueless about), as well as the overly-lengthy processes that the Pentagon goes through in approving new equipment, and the need for the US military to continue to adapt to keep up with the use of AI in commerce.

**3/**

[**Capsule snag $4.75mln for its video editing tool**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/14/capsule-snags-4-75m-for-its-ai-powered-video-editor-that-summarizes-text-generates-images-and-more/)

This is my favourite tool of the day. The creators of **Capsule** have had a tough few years with a few of their start-ups, but they seem to have hit the nail on the head with this one. They‚Äôre targeting **enterprise short-form video** **editing** with AI technology that interacts with clips to do things like insert interactive speech, title sections within the video, summarise sections, and generally be more creative than I could ever dream to be! I feel like I‚Äôm underselling it, so check out the **demo in the link above**.

**4/**

[**Spotify used audiobook creators to train their AI**](https://www.wired.com/story/apple-spotify-audiobook-narrators-ai-contract/)

UH OH, it looks like the legal controversy facing AI art generation is beginning to hit **AI voice generation**. Audiobook distributor **Findaway Voices** is coming under fire by its users for giving **Apple (Spotify)** the rights to use its audiobook content to train ML models. The ML models will ultimately be used to do away with the very people who created them!
