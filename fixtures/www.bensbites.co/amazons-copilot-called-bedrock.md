**1/**

[AWS get stuck into generative AI with Amazon Bedrock](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/13/with-bedrock-amazon-enters-the-generative-ai-race/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ben-s-bites-new-launch)

**AWS**entering the generative AI game makes me feel like an evil villain swivelling on his chair stroking a cat: “Amazon, I’ve been expecting you…”😈

They’ve just released**Amazon Bedrock**, which gives developers the ability to build on top of pre-trained models from a bunch of providers: Stability AI (think image generation), Anthropic (think Claude chatbot), and more. Not only this, but they’re also providing limited access to their in-house language model,**Titan FM**. Oh, and apparently they’ve always had a generative code model called**CodeWhisperer**, which didn’t quite take off like GitHub Copilot… anyway, now it’s free for AWS customers.

**2/**

[Stability AI release Stable Diffusion’s most powerful round yet: XL](https://twitter.com/emostaque/status/1646583898338643968)

**Stability AI**is going in large as they break away in the race for**AI image generation**. And when I say “large” it’s literal: their[latest update](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-xl-beta-available-for-api-customers-and-dreamstudio-users?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ben-s-bites-new-launch)is**Stable Diffusion XL**(SDXL), and it’s improving rapidly with**human feedback**from users. It’s built for enterprise and excels in**photorealism**, has more detailed imagery, can make do with shorter prompts, and produces more legible text in images. (But what about the hands? Can it do hands yet?!) The release also includes image-to-image, inpainting (filling in missing bits), and outpainting (extending images beyond the boundary). Big update from a fast-moving company!

**3/**

[The Spanish are following in the Italian footsteps with OpenAI](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/13/chatgpt-spain-gdpr/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=ben-s-bites-new-launch)

What is it with the Mediterraneans and beef (😏)with**OpenAI**? First Italy, now**Spain**, who say they’re watching the AI company closely over**potential breaches**of EU GDPR regulations. They’ve even gone as far as suggesting that solving these issues may require harmonised and coordinated action from EU members. Uh oh! Who’s next? Greece?

**4/**

[Use augmented reality to build a memory palace of ChatGPT queries](https://twitter.com/yiliu_shenburke/status/1645818242861002755)

I’m enjoying ‘picking’ awesome projects built by one or two people, so I’m gonna throw another in here today. This dude is in the know about memory and palaces and has put**ChatGPT inside AR/VR**so you can build your own mind map of old queries and chats. Interact with them, group them together, and have your very own palace of GPT memories. Very slick demo too!
