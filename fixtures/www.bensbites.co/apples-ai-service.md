### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

**[Apple's got a new audiobook service](https://authors.apple.com/support/4519-digital-narration-audiobooks)**. I forgot Apple Books was a thing, genuinely.

It uses AI to narrate the books instead of humans (of course).

It'll make it easier and cheaper for authors and publishers to make audiobooks. **Say goodbye to expensive, time-consuming recording sessions.**

Right now, it's only available for English-language romance and fiction books and only two voices, Madison and Jackson, are available.

The funny thing is, **Apple is really specific** about which kinds of romance and fiction books it will do. It's only literary, historical, and women's fiction right now. No mysteries, thrillers, science fiction, or fantasy. If you **search for "AI narration" in the Books app**, you'll find a bunch of romance novels narrated by Apple's AI.

As with any AI voice, they're perfectly understandable, but **they don't have the warm, loving tone of a human voice**. But I bet that'll change as AI voice technology improves. Try getting AI to whisper sweet nothings in your ear.

Apple was supposed to launch the service in November, but it got delayed because of all the drama with Elon Musk at Twitter and some layoffs at Meta. Apparently, Apple has been trying to get independent publishers to use its service and is willing to **cover the production costs in exchange for royalties**.

Unlike Apple, **Amazon's Audible service only allows human narrators** (at the moment). But I bet that changes soon.

**Spotify is also trying to make audiobooks** a big part of its streaming service, but it's been having some problems with Apple's rules about in-app payments.

**Apple Books quietly launches AI-narrated audiobooks**. ([link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/5/23540261/apple-text-to-speech-audiobooks-ebooks-artificial-intelligence-narrator-madison-jackson))
