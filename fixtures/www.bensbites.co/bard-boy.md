Hey folks, it‚Äôs Friday and it‚Äôs pissing it down here in the UK, or, raining cats and dogs as we like to say.

Today we have; the roundup on the AI pause, AI WordArt is pretty nostalgic and great, Google accusations of a bad Bard, and single-use software‚Äîwhich doesn‚Äôt sound exciting but I think we‚Äôll see lots of one-time software applications being built because of AI.

Have a great weekend‚Äîmy dad and I are doing a Beef Wellington masterclass at Gordon Ramsay‚Äôs restaurant. I can‚Äôt wait to finally learn how to scream at others in the kitchen. Hope my dad can take it.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

**1/**

[Your full roundup from the pause AI debate](https://stonks.com/blog/the-future-of-lifehttps://stonks.com/blog/the-future-of-life?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy)*(we had two versions of this pick, but went for the shorter one for sanity‚Äôs sake)*

Gary Marcus[responded](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/the-open-letter-controversy?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy)to the criticism. He made many fair points, but the crux:**we can‚Äôt just sit and do nothing.**

But Emad Mostaque (CEO of Stable Diffusion‚Äôs parent company)[chimed](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1641091842812026882?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy)in, saying that\*\*no one can instantly train larger than GPT-4 models anyway,\*\*because the time to set up such hardware will take 6-9 months.

Add Eliezer Yudkowsky to the equation. He was on Lex Fridman‚Äôs[podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AaTRHFaaPG8\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy)and again warns that there‚Äôs**no second chance**with AI alignment. We fail, we die.

Talking of petitions, they just keep on coming! The team at LAION, a non-profit aiming to make\*AI open,\*released their petition for governments to build a[global CERN for AI research](https://twitter.com/laion_ai/status/1641387728855089152?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy)i.e. keep going, baby.

I know, too many links on one story, right? Just chill, read[this one](https://stonks.com/blog/the-future-of-life?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy), and thank me on Twitter.

**2/**

[Adobe Firefly‚Äôs live beta has been going down a treat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WRNtjsKVbJI\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy)

Time for you creative folk to grab the limelight on these picks again, and this time it‚Äôs all about**Firefly**, the exciting new generative AI approach from**Adobe**that got released a few weeks ago.

One of my fav hackers in the community got access and uploaded a neat little intro vid, and I can‚Äôt wait to keep showing off AI to all my designer friends after watching. The**Text-to-Effects tool**is like Microsoft‚Äôs**Word Art on steroids**, somehow giving me both a blast from the past of my childhood*and*making me feel like I‚Äôm in the future.

**3/**

[Google denies Bard was trained with ChatGPT data](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/29/23662621/google-bard-chatgpt-sharegpt-training-denies?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy)

Has Google been a naughty littleboyBard? According to an ex-employee who moved to OpenAI, the team building Bard (Google‚Äôs version of ChatGPT) has been\*\*scraping data\*\*\*\*they shouldn‚Äôt be.\*\*That data is OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT conversational data, shared on a site called ShareGPT.

**Google denied the claims**saying,*‚ÄúBard is not trained on any data from ShareGPT or ChatGPT.‚Äù*

**4/**

**We‚Äôre in a new age of single-use software**

Looking for the tools today, I fell into this rabbit hole of incredible people talking about\*\*single-use software.\*\*Geoffrey from MIT‚Äôs AI lab refers to it as[malleable software](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2023/03/25/llm-end-user-programming.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy)(which we covered on Monday). Others extended the idea in a similar spirit on how it will impact UI design, naming it[dynamic UI](https://twitter.com/jsngr/status/1641108150349873153?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=have-you-been-a-bard-boy).

And all of this discussion has led builders to build out these functionalities.
