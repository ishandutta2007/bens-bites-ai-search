### PLUS: Wikipedia articles as embeddings.

Hey folks, welcome to 6722 of you who joined last week. I‚Äôm off to (hopefully sunny) Mallorca today! I need a break, the last one before the twins arrive in July üò¨.

I‚Äôm hosting an event in NYC, May 22nd alongside TheGP and Betaworks. If you‚Äôd like to come, [check it out](https://lu.ma/fonobatk?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code). Spaces are limited.

Another week in AI and we have Bard starting to write code, Wikipedia turned into embeddings and new contenders of trustworthy AI.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

From our sponsor:

**Generative AI-powered Team Building**

The question is not ‚Äúwhere can you use AI‚Äù but rather ‚Äúwhere can you NOT use it?‚Äù

We‚Äôre applying generative AI creatively to help managers manage their teams more effectively and to grow culture. AI-guided, **contextually-relevant team chats, eNPS analysis, and AI-assisted 1:1 meeting planning** are here now.

### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[Google‚Äôs Bard chatbot coding tools seem to be doing better than ChatGPT](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/googles-bard-ai-chatbot-can-now-generate-and-debug-code/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code)

It looks like**Google**has struggled to master the English language side of their**Bard**model in the race against**OpenAI**, and have decided to sneak back into it via the coding route‚Ä¶ Their flagship chatbot has been updated with**code generation**, debugging, and explanation tools in over 20 different languages. Given that coding is a*huge*use-case of ChatGPT, it‚Äôll be a pretty decent move if they can try to capture this part of the AI market.

And from our experiments and rumours doing the rounds, Bard is actually**much better at coding**as well, so they might just manage to succeed. Also, it shows open-source repos as the source when the code is too inspired by them, brownie points for that.

Original[release](https://blog.google/technology/ai/code-with-bard/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code)and The Verge article[here](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/21/23692517/google-ai-bard-chatbot-code-support-functions-google-sheets?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code).

**2/**

[Cohere AI create a free download of vector embeddings from millions of Wiki articles](https://txt.cohere.com/embedding-archives-wikipedia/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code)

More**open-source**stuff for you lot - wheyyyy - and this time it‚Äôs**Cohere AI‚Äôs**turn to take to the stage of generosity. For those who don‚Äôt know, all these large language models have to convert words into vectors (word embeddings) before using them to train models. Using their in-house method of creating**word embeddings**in multiple languages, Cohere has created a free download of them available from*millions*of**Wikipedia articles**. This is a damn useful dataset that anyone can now download and use.

And if you don‚Äôt fancy downloading a big dataset, this startup**Weaviate**has[hosted them publicly](https://txt.cohere.com/embedding-archives-wikipedia/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code)so that you can access them online.

**3/**

[This startup might become the poster child of responsible AI](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/trustible-emerges-from-stealth-to-enable-responsible-ai-governance-amid-growing-regulatory-concerns-301800735.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code)

Regulation! Responsibility! It might sound boring but it‚Äôs important and we should all care at least a little bit. If you‚Äôre running an AI firm and wanna keep yourself out of hot water, then have an eye on this startup:**Trustible**. They‚Äôre taking the lead in providing in-house services to help companies implement**Responsible AI**practices around the implementation and deployment of AI models. The product aims to seamlessly integrate compliance with standards and, crucially, update itself with**emerging regulations**.

Whilst we‚Äôre on the riveting topic of emerging regulations, check out[this article](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/21/eu-ai-act-generative-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code)on the EU‚Äôs upcoming rules around AI.

And the people? 62% believe AI will have a major impact on workers, 28% think AI will impact them, and **71% oppose AI use in final hiring decisions.**([link](https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2023/04/20/ai-in-hiring-and-evaluating-workers-what-americans-think/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=bard-learns-to-code))
