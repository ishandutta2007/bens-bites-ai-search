### **üéì Learn**

- Learn Prompting - A documentation site **teaching how to use prompts**. ([link](https://learnprompting.org/))

### **üî¨ Research**

- Music2Vec - a self-supervised learning framework for **learning useful representations of raw music waveforms**. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02508))
- NeuralUDF - for **reconstructing surfaces with arbitrary topologies** from 2D images via volume rendering. ([link](https://www.xxlong.site/NeuralUDF/))
- Spatial diffusion model (SDM) for **image inpainting** uses a few iterations to deliver informative pixels to the entire image. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02963))
- Adaptive Diffusion for**Image Reconstruction** (ADIR) exploits the prior learned by diffusion models while retaining agreement with the observations. ([link](https://shadyabh.github.io/ADIR/))
- Universal Document Processing (UDOP), a foundation**Document AI model** that unifies text, image, and layout modalities with varied task formats. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02623))
- M-VADER - a diffusion model for image generation that can be specified using arbitrary **combinations of images and text**. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02936))
- **How machine learning models can learn shortcuts to make correct predictions**, and how input salience methods can be used to verify that models are not relying on such shortcuts. ([link](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/12/will-you-find-these-shortcuts.html))
- RANA - **photorealistic synthesis of humans under arbitrary viewpoints, body poses, and lighting**. ([link](https://nvlabs.github.io/RANA/))
- A **self-supervised approach for correspondence estimation** that learns from multiview consistency in short RGB-D video sequences, which allows for correspondences to be obtained over longer time frames, increasing both the diversity and difficulty of sampled pairs. ([link](https://mbanani.github.io/syncmatch/))
- A new approach to **video understanding using a self-supervised learning method called InternVideo**. ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03191))

([link](https://ref-npr.github.io/))
- MoFusion - a framework for **unified motion synthesis,** which uses a Transformer backbone to ease the inclusion of diverse control signals and pretrains the backbone as a diffusion model. ([link](https://ofa-sys.github.io/MoFusion/))
