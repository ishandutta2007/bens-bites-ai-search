Thanks for reading! Ben‚Äôs Bites is a roundup of what‚Äôs going on in AI.\
*Not subscribed? Do that [here](https://magic.beehiiv.com/v1/447f6e60-e36a-4642-b6f8-46beb19045ec?email={{email}}\&utm_source=top-of-email).*

Great first week for Ben's Bites. Friday's email went out to 270 people, this one is going out to over 700!!! Thank you, this is growing very quickly. 10k in 30 days? Let's see if we can do it.

My project tracker is available if you refer 2 friends to the list - [**using this link**](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER). It has all the links I mention in the emails, filterable and searchable for ease.

There may be a few more links today (and Mondays in general) as I'm catching up with the action from over the weekend. AI never sleeps. And neither can I with all these new shiny toys to play with!

Let's get to it.

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

üìù A new writing tool with a twist\
üßë‚Äçüíª GitHub Copilot code 'borrowing'\
ü•ä AI vs Google search üßä Text-to-3D\
üßë‚Äçüè´ Education links and resources

## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

**Google docs with AI baked in**. [That‚Äôs the promise](https://twitter.com/nbashaw/status/1581673516360876032?s=12\&t=PmEphRc6WiFw49jRs1S7aA) of a new product ‚ÄòLex‚Äô from Nathan Baschez. The waitlist is now over 20k users (I‚Äôm around 2k). You can [view the demo here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Cao0oy1CBg) and [sign up for the list here](https://lex.page/).

Why is this product interesting? Well, it follows the path that Github Copilot has taken. It helps you when you‚Äôre in the workflow. It‚Äôs not something to generate the perfect output off the bat. You write, and it suggests content based on that. **This interface for AI is going to be the big winner**. Otherwise, we end up with a chatbot problem. Enter a question, get an undesirable output, give up, cry, and move on.

Nathan writes for a living. **Creatives who embrace AI are going to be much more productive than those of us trying to BE a writer by using an AI tool.**

*Luckily I know Nathan (fun fact: he wrote the original code for Product Hunt) and am interviewing him about Lex. Hopefully, he‚Äôll give us all an early invite to use the product. If you‚Äôre interested in that, [tweet this](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=bentossell\&text=@nbashaw%20can%20we%20get%20early%20access%20to%20Lex%20for%20Ben%27s%20Bites%20readers%20pls%3F).*

- OpenAI‚Äôs Playground is pretty straightforward but **[this is even easier](https://twitter.com/itsdailyin/status/1580914998850699264)**. Tom made a super simple interface for interacting with GPT-3.

- [**This video render**](https://twitter.com/nerfstudioteam/status/1580590781076688901)**was captured on a phone** (literally walking around the subject), with no drone involved. It‚Äôs so smooth!

- [thismoviedoesnotexist.org](https://thismoviedoesnotexist.org/) uses AI (GPT-3 + StableDiffusion) to [**generate fake movie posters + title + synopsis.**](https://twitter.com/slhomme/status/1580973304923713536?s=12\&t=wn7R0HPjXcQs8RvNd4VT0g)

- Ultra-large AI models are over. No, they‚Äôre not breaking up‚Ä¶But [here‚Äôs an analysis](https://twitter.com/alber_romgar/status/1580967562170732544?s=12\&t=wn7R0HPjXcQs8RvNd4VT0g) on **why AI companies may have reasons not to pursue them.**

- (NO) Panic at The Gradio Disco. Disco stands for Disentangled Image Colorization via Global Anchors. Catchy huh?! **[Essentially, this colourizes images](https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1580959950515277824?s=12\&t=wn7R0HPjXcQs8RvNd4VT0g).**

- Creatives can get so much more out of AI than regular people. IF they embrace it. This music producer did and he [**produced this track and video in 12 hours**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd2KJsdV3Jg) using Stable Diffusion (and his years of experience).

But, what code is it trained on to give its suggestions? [This user](https://twitter.com/docsparse/status/1581461734665367554?s=12\&t=WwOwlgcWLbvK-59LdGOT2A) found **his copyrighted code was used as a suggestion with no attribution**.
