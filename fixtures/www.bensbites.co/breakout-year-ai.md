Hey everyone, my OOO is on and I'm starting my celebrations today with a big, slightly festive, meal.

We're wrapping up (no pun intended) the hackathon winners today and hope to announce them tomorrow before the Christmas weekend.

Let's get to it.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

A thread on **how Home Alone in the style of the opening credits of White Lotus season two was made with Runway**. This is just such a wonderful look at how creative you can be using AI tools. Most likely this would've taken much longer and with a lot more technical skill if AI wasn't as powerful as it is today. (and about to get a whole lot more powerful!) ([<u>link</u>](https://twitter.com/umpherj/status/1605592055450738688?s=20\&t=M5X7Ie2309iwQHS1pEqqKA))

**A breakout year for AI art brings as many questions as answers**. A summary: In 2022, companies working on generative AI raised $1.3bn, a 15% year-on-year increase, according to Pitchbook data. OpenAI's DALL-E 2 image-generation model went viral, with over 3 million users generating over 4 million images per day within five weeks of its public release. Generative AI has been used in a range of industries, but it has also raised ethical and legal questions, including how leading image platforms should approach AI-generated content. One programmer recently sued Microsoft, GitHub, and OpenAI over GitHub Copilot, a generative AI tool that used publicly available computer code to learn to write its own code.

David Friedman talks about the how **complicated problems of the Westworld-like future are already here** with ChatGPT. He went into a role-playing scenario and made ChatGPT have a personality - although it could break character with ((a double bracket)). Again we're seeing a really interesting script-like output that's kind of choose-your-own adventure. Which I'm sure you could just use some Runway magic to turn into a video.

And interestingly, we'll run out of data to train AI in the next 3-4 years which would mean looking at content on Reddit and Twitter - AI trained on AI content?! ([<u>link</u>](https://replai.so/))

- New York Times article on **how OpenAI's ChatGPT & search AI innovations could threaten Google's search dominance**. ChatGPT made Google declare 'code red' (apparently) and got management to seriously think about what the implications are (apparently). Google doesn't want to cannibalise it's ad revenues on search so it'll be interesting to see what their response will be (if any). ([<u>link</u>](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/21/technology/ai-chatgpt-google-search.html)) Related: another article talking about Google's 'code red'. ([link](https://9to5google.com/2022/12/21/google-code-red-chatgpt/))
- A journalist **used OpenAI's ChatGPT chatbot to write essays for high school English classes to test its capabilities**. The chatbot was able to write an 800-word essay on "Ferris Bueller's Day Off" as an existentialist text in under a minute, but it struggled with demand and experienced network errors. It also successfully wrote an essay on "The Great Gatsby," but the teacher noticed some factual errors and that the writing style was too advanced for a high school student.
