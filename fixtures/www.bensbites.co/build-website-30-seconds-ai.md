Hey! Happy Friday.

This is the second full week of Ben's Bites - I hope you're enjoying reading it as much as I'm enjoying writing it.

Let's get into it!

*P.s. I figured out a simple way to add all links to the growing database so you only need to refer 1 person in order to get access (remember to [use this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER)).*

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

- **[Build a website in 30 seconds](https://durable.co/ai-website-builder)** using artificial intelligence. It really was 30 seconds! But scarily it pulled my location without me giving any permission ü§î

- **[A Sci-Fantasy Art Timelapse](https://youtube.com/watch?v=FzEjMvUhAkA)**

- Shares sold in **OpenAI last year valued the company at nearly $20Bn**. A person with direct knowledge of OpenAI‚Äôs finances implied the company was on track to generate revenue in the low tens of millions of dollars this year. Microsoft already invested $1Bn in 2019. Deeper ties with OpenAI would dovetail with Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella‚Äôs goal of drawing more revenue from AI tools in the coming years. Read on [The Information](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-valued-at-nearly-20-billion-in-advanced-talks-with-microsoft-for-more-funding) or [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-in-advanced-talks-to-increase-investment-in-openai-11666299548?st=el689zlz9fougmq).

- **[AI: Startup Vs Incumbent Value](http://blog.eladgil.com/2022/10/ai-startup-vs-incumbent-value.html)**. My AI summary: The current unsupervised learning wave of AI will contain strong startup success, in addition to incumbent value. There are four reasons for this: better technology across many areas, new tech providing valuable infrastructure to the industry, clear app use cases without strong incumbents, and focusing on end-users and markets.

- **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-3 writes about [the history of child mortality](https://www.tonymmorley.com/new-blog-4/open-ais-gpt3-writes-about-the-history-of-global-living-standards)**. A lovely light-hearted read on a Friday.

üëã Too many links?! I created a database for all links mentioned in these emails. Refer 1 friend [using this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER) and I'll send over the link database.

- **[Using AI as a boxing judge](https://superinnovators.com/2022/10/ai-boxing-judge/)** to prevent human errors, and provide analytics on improvements to athletes

- [**Another writing tool**](https://tools.picsart.com/text/ai-writer/), this one from Picsart, - Super Fast AI Copywriting

- [Roll Art Die](https://www.roll-art-die.com/) - **StableDiffusion on your MacBook**

- Text2Light: applies **[photorealistic lighting and 360-degree reflections of 3D scenes](https://frozenburning.github.io/projects/text2light/).**

- **Microsoft is looking for [Research interns](https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/1482647/Research-Intern-AI-for-Good-Lab%E2%80%A6)** at their AI For Good Lab.

- **[High-quality singing voice conversion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11096)**. I can finally hit the high notes a note!

- TANGO: [**Text-driven Photorealistic and Robust 3D Stylization**](https://cyw-3d.github.io/tango/) via Lighting Decomposition

- [A demo video of AI-powered writing](https://twitter.com/kazuki_sf_/status/1583217722057334784) with Glasp. **The system can reflect your taste/identity in the writing!** The fine-tuned model is based on curated information, and it can compensate for one of the weaknesses of the current AI models: the old data issue.

- **[Generate music based on your own music dataset](https://twitter.com/marco_ppasini/status/1583160997942276096)**

- [This animation](https://twitter.com/paultrillo/status/1583114762035961858) shows off **animated face masks, generates jewellery and creates organic rock formations**. Created with DALL-E and Runway.

- **[Text to 3D animation](https://twitter.com/virtualbeings1/status/1583169934057943040)**. Imagine making your own Pixar movie!

- **StabilityAI‚Äôs 1.5 version was ‚Äòleaked‚Äô and requested a takedown of the published model (then later retracted it)**. [Daniel Jeffries wrote a bit about it](https://danieljeffries.substack.com/p/why-the-future-of-open-source-ai), what happened and the reason for it. TLDR is ‚Äúthat if we don't go a little slower + deal with sound feedback from society, our own ML researchers + regulators then there is a chance open source AI simply won't exist.‚Äù

- [An interesting but controversial](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/y98hxs/if_you_believe_you_can_think_exponentially_you/)post from a Redditor ‚ÄúIf you believe you can think exponentially, you might be wrong. **Transformative AI is here, and it is going to radically change the world before the Singularity, and before AGI.**‚Äù

- [Generative AI in VR](https://twitter.com/jasminezroberts/status/1583143311732142082) - **spoken user commands, 3D objects are created, loaded and manipulated via GPT-3**.

- It would cost **[~$35M for training a large language model from YouTube data.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singularity/comments/y92cl1/a_youtube_large_language_model_for_a_scant_35/)**

- If we create AI that *feels*, how will we keep our worst instincts in check? **[A Different Kind of AI Risk: Artificial Suffering](https://superbowl.substack.com/p/a-different-kind-of-ai-risk-artificial).**

- **[US Eyes Expanding China Tech Ban to Quantum Computing and AI](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-20/us-eyes-expanding-china-tech-ban-to-quantum-computing-and-ai)**. Industry experts are weighing in on how to set the parameters of the restrictions on this nascent technology, they said.

## **üñº AI IMAGES OF THE DAY**

Liz Truss, UK's EX Prime Minister had the shortest ever. There was a site seeing who would last longer, Liz or Lettuce. The lettuce won! Also, weirdly my wife's middle name is 'Lettice' üòÇ
