Hey folks, this is Ben‚Äôs Bites, your daily order from the AI drive-through. Today‚Äôs lead chef is Salesforce, bringing a few items on the menu. Served with cocktails from leaving Google employees and model leaks from Meta.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/ Salesforce announces its generative AI plans**

After a series of not-good reasons for being in the news last week, it is now there because of the release of its AI projects. There‚Äôs a lot to cover from this news that I‚Äôm not even sure this is a single highlight.

**[Einstein GPT, the world‚Äôs first generative AI for CRM](https://investor.salesforce.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2023/Salesforce-Announces-Einstein-GPT-the-Worlds-First-Generative-AI-for-CRM/default.aspx)**

Salesforce‚Äôs own AI model for generating content across different functions within their ecosystem (sales, marketing, customer service, development etc.). This will also integrate with OpenAI and other models. Currently in closed beta.

[S](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/07/salesforce-ventures-targets-new-250m-fund-at-generative-ai-startups/)**[alesforce VC fund for Gen AI](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/07/salesforce-ventures-targets-new-250m-fund-at-generative-ai-startups/)**

A $250M fund aimed at generative AI startups with the fund‚Äôs motto being ‚Äúresponsible generative AI.‚Äù As of now they‚Äôve invested in 4 companies:*[You](https://you.com/)**,**[Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/)**,**[Cohere](https://cohere.ai/)*and*[Hearth](https://www.hearth.ai/)\*\*.*

And the biggest of it all:**[ChatGPT for Slack](https://www.salesforce.com/news/stories/chatgpt-app-for-slack/)**

Salesforce owns Slack, and the ChatGPT app for Slack is live (with a[waitlist](https://openai.com/waitlist/slack)). As Noah Weiss, CPO of Slack said,**OpenAI + Slack - It‚Äôs a tasty combo.**

It‚Äôs a symbiotic relationship. You know, when both parties benefit off of each other. OpenAI uses slack for its team and has sent over 5 million messages in their Slack workplace. Now. Slack will use OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT for summarising threads, project-specific question answers, and drafting replies to colleagues.

**2/** **[How Google Became Cautious of AI and Gave Microsoft an Opening](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-ai-chatbot-bard-chatgpt-rival-bing-a4c2d2ad)**

I‚Äôm a mere mortal, and as tired as I am of Google vs Microsoft updates, I still haven‚Äôt got over how Google can get so behind in the AI race. Then comes this article from Wall Street Journal.

Warning you, it is long. Not just another restatement of Google saying they care about AI safety; this one goes deep with stories of employees who developed the **early versions of Google‚Äôs chatbot** and left when the product **didn‚Äôt see the light**of the day. It also goes over the timeline to highlight previous releases from them like LaMDA, Meena, etc.

Overall, it‚Äôs a good overview of what happened with balanced opinions.

**3/** **[Facebook's Powerful Large Language Model Leaks Online](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgwqgw/facebooks-powerful-large-language-model-leaks-online-4chan-llama)**

Facebook (Meta) released their LLM called LLaMa about a week ago, which outperformed the GPT-3 models. They said it was open source, then allegations came up of them being deceptive because weight were not public.

Well, doesn‚Äôt matter because the model got leaked on 4chan. It was supposed to be available for researchers or governments only for the time being but users are running it on their local GPUs. Meta is not shying away from it and talking with the platforms like Huggingface to avoid public-facing products to be created from this leak.
