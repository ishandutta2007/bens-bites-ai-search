Hey everyone, this is Ben's Bites, your daily supplement of AI, without the side-effects,

I spent the morning basically getting my pants pulled down at tennis against a gentleman at least 20 years my senior. I'm totally fine with it üò∂. Some people meditate for 30 mins, I scream bloody murder at myself for 90.

Lets get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

You‚Äôll still ***really struggle*** **to copyright AI art** creations and the **legal proceedings** are now [**there to prove it**](https://twitter.com/icreatelife/status/1617746645533470720).

To be honest, I wouldn‚Äôt have expected copyrighting law to track the insanely rapid AI developments anyway. The topic is inherently complex and somewhat subjective, and I‚Äôm holding hope that in relatively short order it will catch up. I think the view that photographs have more human input than AI art is one that naturally **needs more time than people are giving it**; time for lawmakers and the public to appreciate the prompting work that goes into producing something truly impressive with AI.

**2/**

Does anyone else find it as weird and uneasy as I do being on a Google web page that isn‚Äôt a search result? Anyway, [**this blog post**](https://ai.googleblog.com/2023/01/google-research-2022-beyond-responsible.html?m=1) on Google‚Äôs 2022 run-down and look to the future still has me wondering: When‚Äôs it's ChatGPT competitor coming out?

This is a [**cool take**](https://the-decoder.com/googles-complex-path-to-the-future-of-search/) in light of that exact question, and whether or not **Google** will actually do it in response to competitive danger from OpenAI‚Äôs **ChatGPT**. Google simply won‚Äôt accept the risk of being responsible for misleading or wrong ‚Äòsearch‚Äô results, and subsequently won‚Äôt release the fully-fledged product we‚Äôre all expecting. Who knows!

**3/**

*Quick question*: If you discovered that a technology could do *your* job, would you publicly explain to thousands of people, including your employer, exactly how? The answer is no. Keep that gold to yourself! Except [**this Guardian journalist‚Äôs answer was yes**](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jan/24/chatgpt-artificial-intelligence-jobs-economy), and he just brought **ChatGPT scaremongering** to the mainstream. In the article, he communicates the threat of AI to copywriters like himself by showcasing AI doing his own job‚Ä¶ as well as him. Gulp.

This strange response notwithstanding, as we enter this new age of progress in AI it‚Äôs important not to spend time fretting about the fate of jobs - if they go they go, and if they don‚Äôt they don‚Äôt. Time is better spent looking for ways it can improve productivity at work and in your personal life. We‚Äôll be better off if we learn to dance with AI rather than fight it.

**4/**

**[The best investors in AI](https://twitter.com/kateclarktweets/status/1617957005360234498)**... - who should be on that list?! Kate Clark, from The Information, asked Twitter and I included a few of my favourites, but if you know of any (or are one!) [let Kate know here](https://twitter.com/kateclarktweets/status/1617957005360234498). I'd love to have helped compile the ultimate list. Oh, and let Kate you came from Ben's Bites of course üòä .
