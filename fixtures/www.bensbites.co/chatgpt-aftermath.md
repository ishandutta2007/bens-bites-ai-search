ü•µ What a year last week was! AND welcome to the 4,579 new folks joining from last week. No, that's not a typo, this newsletter flew from ~6k subs to 10,584 at the time of writing. It really means a lot. I'm loving this, I hope you are too!

With the release of ChatGPT, there has been a wave tsunami of tools built, unofficial APIs, chrome extensions and more. You'll see below there are a lot of very similar tools being built. This is just the new normal. Weighing up one tool vs another is really splitting hairs.

Big email today, don't get too overwhelmed. Skim, click, close, and come back. You do you. Let's get to it.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- I‚Äôve said (on Twitter somewhere) that the future of internal tooling will be individuals building their own mini-apps, using AI, that is deployed on their own machines. **Linus spoke with Every about how he‚Äôs already living and working with his own AI tools**. ([link](https://every.to/superorganizers/linus-lee-is-living-with-ai))
- **Building a virtual machine inside ChatGPT**. ([link](https://www.engraved.blog/building-a-virtual-machine-inside/))

- Alberto wrote ‚Äú**ChatGPT Is the World‚Äôs Best Chatbot**‚Äù. My crude summary: It is possible that AI models could become so good that it would be difficult to distinguish them from human-made work, ChatGPT could replace Google as the hegemon of internet search. But, Google has more research capability, talent, and budget than OpenAI and search engines are more reliable than LLMs, as they are not able to make up information.
