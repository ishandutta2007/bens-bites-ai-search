Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got YouTube entering the AI space, OpenAI‚Äôs APIs, behind the scenes of OpenAI‚Äôs CTO, and famous paintings with real characters.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**[YouTube to roll-out generative AI for content creators](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/1/23620143/youtube-ai-tool-features-ceo-neal-mohan-google-alphabet)

Week by week we update you with a new big tech company wading into the AI scene, and today‚Äôs turn is**YouTube**. Given that quite recently a young chap called me an ‚Äúold man‚Äù for watching YouTube shorts, perhaps this is just the move they need‚Ä¶ New**CEO Neal Mohan**has announced that in the coming months,**generative AI**will be available to content creators, where they‚Äôll be able to do things like swap outfits and put themselves into**AI-generated fantastical settings**. With ad revenue dropping 8% vs last year, this will be a welcome development for parent company Alphabet.

**2/**[OpenAI being us APIs for ChatGPT and Whisper at a reduced cost](https://twitter.com/sama/status/1631001111594401793?s=46\&t=KN6q1sosUn2E3wn0g43PwQ)

üö®OpenAI technology updateüö®

Don‚Äôt worry, they haven‚Äôt updated their tech to bring us a step closer to an**AGI**that‚Äôs going to imminently end the world, as Eliezer Yudkowsky and Gary Marcus might be concerned about. Instead, they‚Äôve put their heads together to**reduce costs by 90%**, and passed it straight to the end-user at a 10x cost reduction. The big move involves easy-to-use (I think?)**APIs for both ChatGPT and Whisper**(for those who don‚Äôt know, Whisper is their speech-to-text model). This is a move more in-line with OpenAI‚Äôs**founding principles**of openness and accessibility, working on optimization to reduce costs rather than leaping towards the next best chatbot.

I‚Äôm also giving $1000 each for the most impressive thing built with the new ChatGPT and Whisper API (two separate prizes). Submit your project to <ben@bensbites.co> by Sunday, 5th March, Midnight PT.

**3/**[OpenAI‚Äôs Mira Murati is one of tech‚Äôs biggest innovators](https://www.fastcompany.com/90850342/openai-mira-murati-chatgpt-dall-e-gpt-4)

When things are going really well, there‚Äôs often someone behind the scenes, taking less of the spotlight, but nonetheless driving things forward. In this case, let‚Äôs take a moment to recognise the contributions of**Mira Murati, CTO of OpenAI**.

She‚Äôs been at the forefront of developments in OpenAI‚Äôs technology, bringing up questions about the trade-offs between**creativity and accuracy**. She holds the view that a GPT-4 release will be a significant step for AI, but a little less hype around it would probably be a good thing. Take some time to read the article - it‚Äôs a good read! Unpaywalled version[here](https://archive.vn/9t9gB).

**4/**[Famous paintings in the eyes of generative AI](https://twitter.com/sudu_cb/status/1630618362677194752)

I always love it when there‚Äôs something fun and light-hearted to fill the fourth pick with. This guy has taken some of society‚Äôs best known paintings and seen what**generative AI**can muster up by using the title as a prompt. And he‚Äôs really**brought them to life**- it‚Äôs pretty cool. For me, the funniest is ‚ÄúSelf-portrait, 1889 by Vincent Van Gogh‚Äù - it‚Äôs so real and just so damn normal!

‚Äú**[Hey Zo√´](https://www.loom.com/share/d0db1ef81c034ab28e8b9761ab6ffafd)**, show me subscription revenue by marketing channel in the state that Lebron James was born, in the quarter that Apple released iOS update 14.5.‚Äù

When everyone on your team can **ask questions and get the answers they need**to do their job, better things will happen for your brand.

**Zenlytic** combines the power of Open AI‚Äôs GPT-3 with the accuracy of their own proprietary data model to empower humans with data.
