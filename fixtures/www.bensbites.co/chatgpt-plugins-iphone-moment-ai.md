Hey folks, we got GPT-4 last week and were like, oh, it‚Äôs pretty big. None of us thought to say the same again too soon. Today we have Open AI introducing ChatGPT plugins. Looks like a new developer ecosystem starts now.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

PS: I‚Äôm hosting a ChatGPT plugin hackathon with ‚ÄòDan Shipper‚Äô from Every. [RSVP here.](https://partiful.com/e/0fN9ALmaWtArEtxvEWN9)

From our sponsor:

**Metaview** leverages GPT-4 to create automated, AI-generated interview notes.

Notes are purpose-built for interviewing so accuracy and relevance is **10x better than generic summarization tools.** Companies like Replit, Scale, and Brex use Metaview to save time from manually typing interview notes and focus on high-quality interactions with candidates.

**They‚Äôve just launched on Product Hunt -** **[check it out](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/metaview)**

**1/**[OpenAI‚Äôs Plugin Protocol and Zapier gives everyone a personal AI assistant](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins)

Twitter is*aliiiive*with the latest big step towards AI accessibility - if you know, you know, and if you don‚Äôt, then get to know. OpenAI have started rolling out their\*\*Plugin Protocol,\*\*aka third-party apps with ChatGPT.

Soon enough, you‚Äôre gonna be able to control literally**thousands of apps from within the ChatGPT interface**- insane![Combined with Zapier](https://flight.beehiiv.net/v2/clicks/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJ1cmwiOiJodHRwczovL3phcGllci5jb20vYmxvZy9hbm5vdW5jaW5nLXphcGllci1jaGF0Z3B0LXBsdWdpbi8iLCJwb3N0X2lkIjoiNTRlOTZkZTMtMmQ2OS00OGVlLWEzMWEtNmVmYzVhNGIyZGY5IiwicHVibGljYXRpb25faWQiOiI0NDdmNmU2MC1lMzZhLTQ2NDItYjZmOC00NmJlYjE5MDQ1ZWMiLCJ2aXNpdF90b2tlbiI6IjRjMjA2ZWJmLTJiZWUtNGVlMy04NWJkLWYwYzg0M2Y2NDA1NSIsImlhdCI6MTY3OTY3MzU2OC40NjEsImlzcyI6Im9yY2hpZCJ9.qXtP5946KmhvkOv5MFnD8oGGVyPeVizU_Sh5LppwZj0),it‚Äôs like AI is a flower in full blossom. The Plugin Protocol connects ChatGPT to designated APIs, plus Zapier provides access to 5000+ apps meaning that the combination of the two provides anyone with their own**personal AI assistant.**

You could ask it to read your Slack chat and send a response; you could ask it to pull a specific email, generate a response, and send it; you could even search a Notion database for something you‚Äôve been on the hunt for; you could do almost anything you can think of!

For the developers out there, there‚Äôs a[tool-building protocol](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1638949234681712643); you‚Äôll be able to[execute Python code](https://twitter.com/officiallogank/status/1638952666310103040)in limited sandboxes, set up data retrieval processes, and more. OpenAI‚Äôs Greg Brockman has a bunch of good examples on his Twitter of using ChatGPT plugins. For example,[this tweet](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1638971232443076609)about processing a video clip. Check them out.

**2/**[OpenAI‚Äôs Code Interpreter is taking LLM coding to the next level with the Plugin](https://andrewmayneblog.wordpress.com/2023/03/23/chatgpt-code-interpreter-magic/)

So the Plugin Protocol is incredible for everyone - techy or not - but let‚Äôs go for a deeper dive into the OpenAI‚Äôs**Code Interpreter**(CI) and its power alongside the**Plugin**. According to this post the combination is*magic*, and it sure looks that way, with a load of wicked first-off-the-pass examples. One of the most powerful things is its ability to**chain different blocks of code**from different APIs together to produce an output - this guy got ChatGPT to build a full-on Pac-Man game and convert it to a usable Gif. On top of this, he showed us how it can use an OCR tool to extract contents of an image and save it to a txt file; how it can generate funky sounds and save them to a wav file for you; and for you hackers who wanna insert creepy ASCII images into things, it seems to be able to create them from anything too‚Ä¶ Read the blog post, have a play yourself, and get stuck in!

**3/**[Tome launch the first live document-to-presentation tool](https://beta.tome.app/)

Since you‚Äôre all so lovely to me I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm getting mildly bored of the same-but-different business productivity tools popping up all over the place. But**Tome**really impressed me when I first came across their $43m Series B, so I‚Äôm pretty stoked to see they‚Äôve actually launched the first**document-to-presentation AI tool**. Built on GPT-4, it‚Äôs able to take a document and turn it into presentations, narratives, and stories using generative text and images. With their own innovative tile system, this isn‚Äôt just another generative PowerPoint tool, and I genuinely think it provides a**strong competitor to Microsoft**in this space - it just looks so damn slick!
