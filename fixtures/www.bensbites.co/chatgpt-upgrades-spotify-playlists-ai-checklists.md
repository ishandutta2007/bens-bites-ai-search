Hey everyone, this is Ben's Bites: The AI newsletter that will make you laugh, learn, cringe and want more, just like a Ryan Reynolds' movie.

Request: I've[set up a feedback form](https://forms.gle/VKT31iQYLt5LwkVc6) (takes ~2 minutes) and I'd love your take. Please select the options you prefer and I'll use it to make this email better. ty ty.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

The handsome marketing magician is at it again...**Ryan Reynolds** recorded this video where he **[asked ChatGPT to write a commercial, in his voice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_eHjifELI-k)** (swearing and all), for Mint Mobile (which he owns/part-owns?) ChatGPT isn't nearly as handsome as Ryan, but it's marketing chops aren't all that bad! Did I mention I think Ryan Reynolds is handsome? Don't worry, my wife agrees.

**ChatGPT** got some shiny new **upgrades**; improvements to the model - which is very vague - but it should be 'generally better'. Shouldn't we all?! And, stop generating - you know, when its spitting out nonsense and you just wish it would stop!!! Yeah, it's got that now. **[ChatGPT, coming soon to your bank account](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1612880530273406988) -**It's also looking at monetisation methods (via OpenAI's Discord). AND, OpenAI have opened a**waitlist** for it's professional, paid, version of ChatGPT. ([link](https://twitter.com/gdb/status/1612986134048698369?s=20\&t=AF27qvjIfswZfnQco28dDw))

What would happen if **ChatGPT** and **Wolfram Alpha** had a baby? [Find out here](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/01/wolframalpha-as-the-way-to-bring-computational-knowledge-superpowers-to-chatgpt/).

I built a **Photo Restorer with Zapier and Replicate**. Input an image, an automation takes it through an AI API and spits back a restored image! It actually works, although could use some finer tweaks. ([link](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1612821552449429504))

### **üõ†Ô∏è Cool Tools**

- Langotalk - **Learn** **languages** 6x faster by chatting with AI. ([link](http://langotalk.org))
- Retune - **Build** GPT-3 powered **apps** without writing any code. ([link](https://retune.so/))
- OriginalityAI - **Plagiarism** checker and AI detector. ([link](https://originality.ai/))
- checklist.gg - AI-driven **checklists.**([link](https://checklist.gg/))
- Playlist AI - Create **playlists** from AI prompts, images, videos, and your most-listened-to music. Two things I'm awful at: a job and listening to music. I'm picky and like 80s/90s hip-hop like NWA that is sort of lost by these fluffy rappers who just speak with elongated words. That aint rappin' and it aint singing. Move along. Anyway, I got sent this link and it does a pretty good job of generating a Spotify playlist based on artists you like. Give it a go and lmk what you think. ([link](https://www.playlistai.app/))
