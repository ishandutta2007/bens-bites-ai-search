Hey folks, today we’ve got voice assistants like ‘Her’ and Jarvis not that far away, ChatGPT used to win $123k in a hackathon, the job market impact of GPT, Runway’s text-to-video model, and lots more!

Let’s get to it.

p.s. we’re booking sponsors from 10th April onwards (we’ll be at 70k subs by then 🤯). Book a slot [here](https://sponsor.bensbites.co/).

p.p.s. I’m looking for a salesperson/people - 25% commission (no base), to apply; get a sponsor to book and mention you referred them, then ping me 🙂

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[The “Her” voice assistant allows you to interact with your emails by voice](https://twitter.com/justLV/status/1637876167763202053)

As much as I love chatting with my Alexa, it’s great to see that we’re finally getting**better\*\*\*\*voice assistants**than Amazon’s and Apple’s. This guy has built a voice assistant that lets you**converse with your emails**to level-up productivity, and he’s used Eleven Labs to hook it up with a**realistic (?) voice**. The inclusion of GPT-3.5 and LLM chaining means you can ask it to do things like “Check for emails in the last month about X”, “Who was CCd on that last email?”, and even generate responses for you. If this sorta interactive tech can be integrated into your email apps, then there’ll be pretty awesome extensions to day-to-day products that’ll basically just be better than Alexa.

**2/**

[ChatGPT was used to with a hacking competition, breaking through guardrails](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chatgpt-helped-win-a-hackathon-96332de4)

Warning: I’m about to go all Gary Marcus and Eliezer Yudkowsky on you lot. Despite all the guardrails and safety nets that OpenAI has stuck onto ChatGPT, it looks like it can still be leveraged for some**naughty business**… The very aptly-named**Pwn2Own Hackathon**brings hackers together to take over industrial systems and guess what - the winners pocketed the $123k prize**using ChatGPT**for help. They say they used it to help them quickly chain a load of bugs together, allowing them to collect vulnerabilities and exploit the system. I’m starting to think there’s always gonna be some way around it, and they might always be easier than they first seem.

**3/**

[GPTs are GPTs: An Early Look at the Labor Market Impact Potential of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10130)

We mentioned this in the research section yesterday, but it needs more of a highlight. In the paper, it mentions**occupations most vulnerable to LLM impact**: survey researchers, translators, writers, tax preparers - the list goes on… there’s a dive into ‘Exposure to GPTs by Job Zone’, essentially what requires a high degree of human interaction etc.\*\*GPT could affect 50%\*\*of the tasks necessary for around 19% of current jobs in the US. I think that’s exciting, not worrying.

**4/**

[Runway release Gen-2: A multi-modal AI system that can generate novel videos with text, images, or video clips](https://research.runwayml.com/gen2)

The model is the first publicly available **text-to-video model**on the market and can **generate videos from text descriptions in a realistic and seamless manner**. Although the demos are not realistic, it’s a big leap in the right direction for what’s to come. It’s bonkers that this is possible and getting better all the time. Gen-1 was only released on Feb 6th - the pace here is phenomenal.
