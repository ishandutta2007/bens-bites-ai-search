Hey folks this is Ben's Bites - a really witty writer would be able to come up with a funny analogy for what it is...

### 🤌 Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**MedARC: The decentralised, open-source Medical AI Research Center**](https://twitter.com/MedARC_AI/status/1623731098181337089?s=20\&t=zijrYMNz_eDOpJduEg_-cg)

Chatbot AI has become *very important*. Medicine is somewhat *more important*. So what’s going on in the world of **medical AI**? Enter **MedARC**, partnered with **StabilityAI**. Given the importance of getting medical advice right, their premise is that medical AI should be a **foundational model**, like that of ChatGPT or Stable Diffusion.

To achieve this style of effective model, they’re sparking an open-sourced, decentralised community in which to share datasets and research advances within the field, work collaboratively, and develop **AI-driven advances in medicine**. Thinking about the advances in biochemistry over the past year as a result of AI, this is something to get *super excited*about!

**2/**

[**Magician: the AI assistant to help you develop and design**](https://blog.diagram.com/p/introducing-genius)

For those of you as artistically inept as I am, a creative side-kick is pretty much essential to produce anything as slick as Microsoft’s new Bing interface. Well, worry no more, because **Genius** is releasing **Magician**, an AI tool that follows you around as you’re **designing and creating** a UI, suggesting additions of icons, buttons, and **aesthetics** alongside you. It looks kinda like someone there to bounce ideas off who has control of your screen - perfect!

**3/**

[**Enter the age of the CAIO**](https://www.fastcompany.com/90847356/every-fortune-500-business-needs-a-chief-ai-officer)

You gotta love the coining of a phrase, and this one is more relevant than ever: the **Chief AI Officer** (CAIO). As AI gets increasingly embedded (no pun intended) into our everyday lives, the field will be integral to the progression of any large company going forward. Hiring effective ML teams won’t be enough, and CAIOs will be essential to drive large-scale company decisions to make real differences. Don’t become a dinosaur firm - hire a CAIO.

**4/**

[**Using machine learning to detect aliens**](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/02/06/ai-potential-alien-signals/)

Yep, you heard that right. Thought I’d keep things wacky to end the week - because why not!? These scientists have been training ML models to learn the characteristics of sounds that are typical of the cosmos. When unfamiliar sounds are detected, shout “ALIENS!”

*Are you tired of the endless search for top engineering talent for your startup?* *[Look no further than](https://lemon.io/alternative-for-startups/?utm_source=newsletter\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=ben%27sbites_demand_en_1_feb_2023\&utm_id=im)*[*Lemon.io*](http://Lemon.io)[*!*](https://lemon.io/alternative-for-startups?utm_source=newsletter\&utm_medium=social\&utm_campaign=ben%27sbites_demand_en_1_feb_2023\&utm_id=im)
