Hello and welcome to the 4,543 new folks joining from last week.

The stag do was as heavy as expected and I lost my voice. Just in time for my trip to Milan on Wednesday - a little birthday visit for my wife.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[The Chinese government have probably caused them to fall behind in AI](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/17/business/china-chatgpt-microsoft-openai.html)

I‚Äôm a comically big fan of the phrase ‚Äúarchitect of your own demise‚Äù, so I‚Äôm over the moon that I‚Äôm able to kick off this week‚Äôs picks with exactly that: Has the Chinese government been the **architect of*****their*****own demise** in the race for AI dominance? The New York Times argues that **excessive censorship**, geopolitical tensions with the US, and attempts to control private sector companies have led to Chinese companies **falling behind their US counterparts in AI**. In addition to this, a lack of control over the chip market could limit their ability to harness the computing power necessary to catch up going forward.

[Lessons learned from integrating ChatGPT into education](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/my-class-required-ai-heres-what-ive)

As we‚Äôve touched on a number of times in this newsletter, at Ben‚Äôs Bites we‚Äôre big fans of integrating AI into the education system and embracing the change associated with doing so. Ethan Mollick provides an update on the **lessons learned so far from integrating ChatGPT** into his curriculum. They‚Äôre undoubtedly eye-opening and I‚Äôm looking forward to hearing more from him on this!

Two key takeaways: 1) Work produced by prompting with a **co-editing approach** (bouncing ideas back and forth with the chatbot) tends to end up with students doing the best work; 2) Students **need to be taught**how to write prompts effectively - it doesn‚Äôt come naturally!

**3/**

[Roblox to bring generative AI into its gaming universe](https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-generative-ai-gaming-universe/)

I used to have an absolutely wild time discovering cheat codes that created flying cars and all sorts of other mania in Grand Theft Auto when I was younger. **Roblox**, the gaming company, are about to take sneaky cheat codes to a whole new level with AI. As far as I can tell, users will be able to enter **textual descriptions of game mods** - customising weapons, changing colours, creating new cheat codes - and AI will generate under-the-hood code to get them implemented in real-time. Wicked!
