# Conversational answer engine - huh?!

### PLUS: The AI application layer and moats.

Hey folks, it's Friiiiyay! ü§¢ - don't be the person to **ever** say that.

We had our first official meetup yesterday in London and I loved it. **[Balderton Capital](https://www.balderton.com/)** hosted ~200 of us in their offices and provided fab food and drinks. A big TY to them!

And a **massive** thank you to those who came, I spoke to as many of you as possible and it was so awesome having that many people come together all because of a bloody email I write sat in my pyjamas at home üò≥. You're real, which is a relief! And I feel incredibly lucky that you give up space in your inboxes each day for me to pop in, give you a load of tabs, ruin your productivity then leave to do it again the next day. It's a joy. Honestly.

We've had some folks talk about hosting the next one and sponsoring another hackathon so stay tuned for that.

Okay ben you're babbling, let's get to it.

p.s. those gyoza were awesome, wish I'd thrown a load in my bag for the train home!

### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

Queue "The Boys Are Back In Town" on Spotify...Perplexity have come out swinging on their third (?) release. **[Perplexity Ask: World‚Äôs first conversational search engine](https://www.perplexity.ai/).**

Basically, like ChatGPT where you chat back and forth, now you can search (like you would on Google) and **Perplexity will provide answers plus sources for those answers and any related links**. You don't have to do the work of searching through those search results that came from your search. Phew.

It prompts you to ask follow up questions to dig a little deeper. Further down the rabbit hole we go! Perplexity say "We‚Äôre working towards **a conversational answer engine**: i.e. ChatGPT + latest references pulled from a search engine." You can read their announcement thread [here](https://twitter.com/perplexity_ai/status/1616120452338036736).

#### 2/

Artificial General Intelligence is so yesterday - it‚Äôs all about Artificial Domain Intelligence these days. In fact, [**Scenario**, **the generative gaming company who just** **received $6m**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/01/19/scenario-lands-6m-for-its-ai-platform-that-generates-game-art-assets/), are taking it one step further. They‚Äôve built a platform on which users can**tune existing generative models** on their particular art styles with **a focus on gaming**.

This seems to be the way AI is progressing. With the realisation that tools such as ChatGPT require extensive context to be most effective, it seems that **domain-level branches will grow from its root to produce many highly-effective, domain-specific AIs**.

3/

A great piece by Rex Woodbury, **[AI in 2023: The Application Layer Has Arrived](https://digitalnative.substack.com/p/ai-in-2023-the-application-layer)**, talking about the world of AI and what that future might look like. It's interesting because he touches on **business models we already know** (SaaS, Marketplaces, etc) having a sort of second-coming **with AI at the helm** - what will that look like? He also touches on **moats and where companies have them** (or not).

[Sahil](https://twitter.com/shl) invests in early-stage startups, $100k-$250k at a time. He‚Äôs an investor in Figma, Notion, and Vercel. And you?! Send him an email at <sahil@hey.com>. He'll be at the Scale AI Hackathon Jan 21st - tomorrow!
