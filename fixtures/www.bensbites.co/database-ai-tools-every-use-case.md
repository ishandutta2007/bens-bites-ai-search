Phew! What a decade this year has been for AI. We've seen a bunch of advancements released publicly; text-to-3d, text-to-speech, Whisper, ChatGPT, DALLE + API, Stable Diffusion, Midjourney and much much more. Plus this newsletter! ‚ù§Ô∏è

I started this email as a fun way to keep up to date with AI projects, research and news every day. I gave myself 30 days to see how it was received and it was received VERY WELL. Which is all thanks to you! 16k subscribers later and going into the year with more motivation to grow it, and make it better. And it's still really enjoyable to write and see how it's helping a bunch of you whether its at work, for your projects or just being in the know.

I appreciate all of you and the space you allow me to occupy in your inboxes.

Let's get to it!

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

ChatGPT generated content vs McKinsey article on "**How tools like ChatGPT can change your business**". This is such an awesome use case of ChatGPT and these kinds of consultants could be at risk of being replaced by their AI counterparts. There's a ton of use cases for these kinds of outputs; generative AI ideas, finding AI ways to help different companies, and much much more.
