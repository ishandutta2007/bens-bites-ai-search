### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[Stability AI release a text-to-image model that can render text properly](https://stability.ai/blog/deepfloyd-if-text-to-image-model?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=double-win-for-open-ai)

**Stability AI**are really hitting the ground running at the moment - we‚Äôve got a double pick for them today with two**model releases**. First up is a new**text-to-image**model they‚Äôve named**DeepFloyd IF**, and it really is the moment we‚Äôve all been waiting for - it can actually do a half decent job of rendering text in generated images! Finally! (No news on fingers though‚Ä¶)[Secondly](https://stability.ai/blog/stablevicuna-open-source-rlhf-chatbot?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=double-win-for-open-ai), they‚Äôve open-sourced a language model called**StableVicuna**, claiming that it‚Äôs the first large-scale instruction fine-tuned and RLHF model. Available on Hugging Face too!

**2/**

[Amazon plan to improve Alexa using large language models](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/28/amazon-working-improved-llm-to-power-alexa/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=double-win-for-open-ai)

Well if this isn‚Äôt overdue then I don‚Äôt know what is -**Amazon‚Äôs Alexa**might be about to get the upgrade we‚Äôve all been expecting since language models really hit the scene last year. CEO Andy Jassy is rallying behind the idea of building the**world‚Äôs best personal assistant**, and Alexa is the obvious place to start. It can be such a frustrating thing to use at times, and using the current powerful state-of-the-art language models could be just the kick it needs.

**3/**

[OpenAI‚Äôs monster funding round](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/28/openai-funding-valuation-chatgpt/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=double-win-for-open-ai)and[appeasing the Italians](https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/28/23702883/chatgpt-italy-ban-lifted-gpdp-data-protection-age-verification?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=double-win-for-open-ai)

As if that $10 bill from Microsoft wasn‚Äôt enough,**OpenAI**have just gone and got\*\*$300m**from a bunch of VCs - that gives them a valuation of close to**$30 billion\*\*‚Ä¶ On another OpenAI note, they‚Äôve managed to win the Italians over! After getting a to-do list from the tech watchdog there, OpenAI duly complied and**ChatGPT**is back up and running in the Med. They‚Äôll have to provide training data info, will have an opt-out form for using your data for training, and have an age confirmation box. I wonder if their willingness and speed with complying will encourage more countries to follow in Italy‚Äôs footsteps?
