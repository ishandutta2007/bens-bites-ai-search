Hey everyone. This is Ben's Bites, We're the Chipotle of AI: fast, fresh, and always on the cutting-edge. Plus we always give you a little extra üòâ

I built an \*\*[app demo that lets you analyse and qualify leads](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1617580011896311808)\*\*using Zapier and OpenAI. You can clone/remix it for yourself. Essentially when someone fills out a form, AI will tell you whether its important, neutral or unimportant. This could be used for a gazillion use cases. If you build anything with Zapier + OpenAI, ping me @bentossell on Twitter!

Let's get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

If you find it as painfully uncomfortable to listen back to your own voice recordings as I do, then it‚Äôs time for you to despair, because **voice synthesis AI** is starting to gain traction amongst investor circles. [**ElevenLabs received a $2m**](https://blog.elevenlabs.io/elevenlabs-raises-2m-pre-seed-and-announces-ai-speech-platform-promising-to-revolutionize-audio-storytelling/) pre-seed for their company that produces realistic **text-to-audio** voice synthesis. They also extend existing recordings in **audio-to-audio** development, with long-term plans for this to work across languages. Yes, that‚Äôs right, your pain might one day be available in *every* language.

It‚Äôll be pretty cool for the **third stage in the big AI wave** to begin with synthetic voice generation (the first being generative art, the second being chat-bots). With the accelerating popularity of audio-books, which are currently very expensive to produce, there could be some serious revenue in this realm with equally serious societal benefits.

And for a sneak peek at a real life pitch deck for a real life tech start-up with real life VC funding, [**this report**](https://sifted.eu/articles/generative-ai-audio-elevenlabs/) includes the ElevenLabs one!

#### 2/

The first bit of big gun shade has officially been thrown, with **Meta‚Äôs Chief AI Scientist** Yann LeCun saying that [**ChatGPT isn‚Äôt that innovative**](https://www.zdnet.com/article/chatgpt-is-not-particularly-innovative-and-nothing-revolutionary-says-metas-chief-ai-scientist/), that lots of labs already do it, and **Meta could and will** do so too. Sounds a *little* bit sour, and reminds me of the Big Short quote ‚Äúbeing late is the same as being wrong‚Äù. Yann, perhaps you‚Äôre just a little bit late? (To be fair, he does kind of have a point‚Ä¶)

#### 3/

Is Artificial Domain Intelligence the route to commercialising AGI? I‚Äôve been enjoying the pieces of discussion that have been circulating on domain specialisation using generative AI models, and Lead Data Scientist for FinCrime at KPMG [**summarises it well here**](https://medium.com/@op.oliverprice/forget-artificial-general-intelligence-its-all-about-artificial-domain-intelligence-77f663c0e880).

#### 4/

Playground AI announces AI-first image editing. Instruct an AI to synthesise **spectacular yet subtle edits**. We're seeing a lot of products implementing [InstructPix2Pix](https://www.timothybrooks.com/instruct-pix2pix/) - a method for editing images from human instructions, which I believe is what's being used here.
