Soooo Twitter was unusable for me yesterday as [my thread on ChatGPT use cases](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1598269692082151424) went viral! But it's seriously such a game-changer that it's hard not to be impressed by the ways people are using it.

The weekend is finally here, it's been a long, exhausting week. Let's get to it.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- **The future of work in the age of AI.** This is a great read and talks about the new work process of the future: a human comes up with a creative prompt, uses AI to do the bulk work, and then the human tweaks and refines the output. An AI sandwich. Yum. ([<u>link</u>](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/generative-ai-autocomplete-for-everything)) A related thread talks about the future of work is like being a director. ([<u>link</u>](https://twitter.com/shaun_harrison/status/1597346081464979456))
- This is so awesome; **Danny mentors a young lad with poor literacy skills who is starting a landscaping business. He struggles to communicate with clients in a professional manner. So, Danny created a GPT3-powered Gmail account to which he sends a message**. It responds with the text to send to the client. OpenAI liked it so much they are collaborating to make a tool specifically for these kinds of use cases AND it was made with no-code: **Gmail>Zapier>GPT3>Gmail** AND the landscaper just **secured his first contract worth ¬£220k**. ([<u>link</u>](https://twitter.com/dannyrichman/status/1598254671591723008)) You can see the walkthrough of how it works [<u>here</u>](https://www.seotraininglondon.org/gpt3-business-email-generator/).
- **Concepted a New Disney/Marvel release** Bashenga: The First Black Panther. ([<u>link</u>](https://twitter.com/shaun_harrison/status/1596556712676233216))
