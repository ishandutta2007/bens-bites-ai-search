Hey folks, today we have new updates from OpenAI regarding using custom functions with models, context length, pricing, and old model shutdown.

Also, Beatles is going to release a last song using AI voice for John Lennon, and there are some reports about the confusion between Microsoft and OpenAI‚Äôs unique deal.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

**Next-Level Automation series with Zapier**

Hey y‚Äôall! It‚Äôs Ivory, a social media specialist at Zapier. I‚Äôm here to kickstart the Next-Level Automation series with Zapier, where we‚Äôll spotlight new ways AI can revolutionize your day-to-day work.

Like most social media managers, I used to spend countless hours managing our social media accounts, responding to comments, and creating content across several platforms. I created an AI-powered content-creating chatbot to help me cut those hours in half. Now I spend less time on the manual tasks that drain my brain power and more time focused on deeply understanding the industry, improving our engagement, and generating valuable insights to drive our social media strategy.

I‚Äôll be showing you how I created this handy chatbot at Zapier‚Äôs first-ever[Zapathon](https://zapier.com/resources/webinar/zapathon-put-ai-to-work?utm_campaign=-gbl-evnt-ooc-ai_june2023_webinar-\&utm_medium=paid\&utm_source=bens_bites)on June 20th. Myself and dozens of other Zap Builders will be showcasing practical AI-powered Zapier workflows you can use in your day-to-day work*and*sharing our best tips to help you build your own. I‚Äôd love to see you there! Join me[here](https://zapier.com/resources/webinar/zapathon-put-ai-to-work?utm_campaign=-gbl-evnt-ooc-ai_june2023_webinar-\&utm_medium=paid\&utm_source=bens_bites).

[The Beatles to make one-song comeback via AI](https://www.semafor.com/article/06/13/2023/paul-mccartney-beatles-song-ai?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=the-final-beatles-song-with-ai-it-s-official)

Stop the presses, folks, 'cos**The Beatles are staging a comeback!**And no, I haven't been nipping at the cooking sherry - it's all**thanks to AI.**

The Fab Four are dusting off a**1978 composition, 'Now and Then'**, courtesy of the late, great John Lennon. The tune's been sitting on the shelf since before Lennon's untimely departure, but now it's getting restored using AI.

Sir Paul McCartney shared some thoughts about the whole affair, and it's a bit of a mixed bag. On the one hand, he's got some reservations about AI (don't we all?), but he's also jazzed about the\*\*chance to hear Lennon's "pure" voice again,\*\*courtesy of our robot overlords. "Scary but exciting," he said, and I reckon that hits the nail on the head.

[The Awkward Partnership Leading the AI Boom](https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsoft-and-openai-forge-awkward-partnership-as-techs-new-power-couple-3092de51?mod=djemalertNEWS\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=the-final-beatles-song-with-ai-it-s-official)

The power couple of the AI world, Microsoft and OpenAI, aren't quite living the dream, it seems. Word on the street is Microsoft‚Äôs unconventional deal (49% stake in the for-profit arm of Open AI) has been a bit of a headache, stirring up conflict and confusion.

It's a whole mixed bag -**issues with transparency**of model architecture, Customers getting**separate sales pitches**from both parties, and**Microsoft‚Äôs cash split**between in-house AI and OpenAI. The partnership is weird, and how this goes will shape the startup-incumbent narrative for the next decades.

[Function calling and other API updates](https://openai.com/blog/function-calling-and-other-api-updates?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=the-final-beatles-song-with-ai-it-s-official)

And as we are talking about Open AI, they announced massive changes to their models and APIs.

The biggest one isgiving GPT-3.5 and GPT 4 the power to\*\*call functions provided by the developer.\*\*It's basically like ChatGPT Plugins, but for your own code. The next big thing is larger context window, not in GPT-4, but in GPT 3.5 turbo.

Remember that interview where Sam Altman mentioned that getting 32k context with GPT-4 to more people is not possible atm? They came up with the solution by**increasing the context window for 3.5 turbo to 16k**(from the previous window of 4k). Also, there are cost reductions in Embeddings and Chat models.
