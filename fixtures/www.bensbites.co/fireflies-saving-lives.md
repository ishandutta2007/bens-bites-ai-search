Hey folks, Big Bill (aka Bill Gates) came out with the best piece written about AI I‚Äôve seen, Google shipped‚Ä¶a waitlist (but I got access, as did many others!), Adobe Fireflies into action with it‚Äôs AI tools and NVIDIA the massive woolly mammoth in the room rolls out some interesting new stuff‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs get to it.

### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[Bill Gates opines on the state of AI and how it can be used for good](https://www.gatesnotes.com/The-Age-of-AI-Has-Begun)

Don‚Äôt forget about**Bill Gates**! In this GatesNotes piece, the man himself reminisces about**how Microsoft began**with the Windows GUI, and compares that momentous occasion to the beginning of GPT/chatbot AI development. He runs through the positive roles that AI can play in**education**, possibly tailoring approaches to different students, whilst expressing that it‚Äôll*never*replace student-teacher interaction.**Healthcare**takes a focus too, with a discussion over freeing up admin times to let doctors do more doctoring, as well as providing AI advice to poorer areas with less access to hospitals. The overarching, game-changing aspect: eventually the main way of controlling a computer won‚Äôt be tapping and clicking, but typing out a simple request. Give it a read - it‚Äôs probably the best overview of AI I‚Äôve seen!

**2/**

[Google drop the waitlist for Bard, their search engine chatbot](https://bard.google.com/)

Is this gonna be a real-world case of the tortoise and the hare? Is the frog about to leap? This feels like a really late follow-up to Microsoft‚Äôs Bing AI, but let‚Äôs ground ourselves for a second here - it‚Äôs only actually been a few months. Time just flies damn fast in this space. Anyway,**Google**has[finally created](https://blog.google/technology/ai/try-bard/)a waiting list for**Bard**, which is coming as a lightweight/optimised version of their**LaMBDA LLM**. To my delight, I was on the waitlist for about 2 minutes before I got access. It has a google search button under every reply but feels pretty solid. Tech outsiders are about to see a big**awareness shift**.

**3/**

[Adobe Firefly: their very own generative AI for creatives](https://www.adobe.com/sensei/generative-ai/firefly.html)

Guys, we have a big dog wading into the generative art space, so this is*Clifford levels*.**Adobe**is pulling out all the shots with**Firefly**, their very own**generative AI model for creatives**, editors, artists, and any one of the ridiculous number of people that use Adobe on a daily. It‚Äôs only in beta for now, with waitlists and all that, so don‚Äôt get too excited. But they have a lot in the pipeline. You‚Äôll be able to highlight part of a photo and generate variations; type out prompts to generate edits for a*specific part*of a photo; generate**custom styles and textures**from your sketches; and even edit videos with a text-based description.

**4/**

[NVIDIA are becoming an enterprise-first AI provider](https://twitter.com/drjimfan/status/1638211601944948736?s=12\&t=4DFLsyWB2nlmdJs1ZUkj1A)

Talking of big dogs wading into spaces,**NVIDIA**are about to take itself from computer chip nerds to a full-on AI service provider, and they‚Äôre going*all out*. With**NVIDIA AI Foundations**, they‚Äôre marketing themselves as an enterprise-first AI provider, helping clients to build**custom multimodal LLMs**and generative models for their varying and fine-tuned use cases. There are some big partnerships going on for the generative images side of the ‚Äúmulti‚Äù in ‚Äúmultimodal‚Äù: Getty Images, Shutterstock, and Adobe. Looks like they‚Äôve taken heed of the copyright complaintsüòÖ. Check out the link for examples of projects based around Foundations.

*From our sponsors:*
