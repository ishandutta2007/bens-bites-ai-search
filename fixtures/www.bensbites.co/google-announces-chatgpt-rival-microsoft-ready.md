Hey folks, this is Ben's Bites - a little less bite than usual today as I've just had a tooth out ü¶∑. So I'm on liquids for a couple of days and I'll leave the chewing to you.

A few big AI dishes today, let's get to it.

p.s. I just launched [a free AI job board](https://gigs.bensbites.co/). Post any kind of gig you want on there.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Google announce an upcoming chatbot search engine**](https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/)

The **Microsoft vs Google saga** is *seeeeriously* heating up right now. Hot on the heels of the announcement of a **ChatGPT-powered Bing**, Google‚Äôs ‚Äòcode red‚Äô has turned into code **Bard** - the name of their very own chatbot that could power their very own search engine. And it looks like it does everything that the former can!

But to add fuel to the fire, **Microsoft has announced** a SURPRISE [**media event today**](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsoft-surprise-event-chatgpt-openai-bing-2023) alongside Google‚Äôs on Wednesday. This is their chance to really give them a run: demos of the new Bing? Demos of AI-driven Teams meetings? AI-generated powerpoints? These could all be on the agenda‚Ä¶ If I‚Äôve got my timings right, it should be at 6pm London time, 10am Washington time - not too long after this hits your inbox!

Apple are also hosting an 'AI Summit' for staff [according to this post.](https://9to5mac.com/2023/02/06/apple-to-hold-in-person-ai-summit-event-for-employees-at-steve-jobs-theater/) It's notable as it's being held in the Steve Jobs Theater at the Apple HQ and streamed to employees also.

OH and ALSO, Baidu is launching 'Ernie Bot' in March and saw their share price increase 13%! ([paywall removed](https://archive.is/4yG5O))

**2/**

[**Getty images sue Stability AI for stealing images**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/6/23587393/ai-art-copyright-lawsuit-getty-images-stable-diffusion)

Uh oh, there‚Äôs about to be some instability going on at **Stability AI**‚Ä¶ Getty images have officially filed a **lawsuit** against them for using 12 million (yes, *12 million*) images illegally to create their AI art machine. Big, scary phrases like **‚Äúbrazen infringement‚Äù** and ‚Äústaggering scale‚Äù are getting thrown around by lawyers.

This could be the start of a shift in the speed with which AIs get released going forward, where companies are gonna have to have more care for the contents of their training data, and probably spend more money on it too.

**3/**

[**Educational chatbot on Telegram**](https://edwardbot.com/)

I always thought Telegram was just for Bitcoin Bros, but [**these guys**](https://dayoff.substack.com/p/its-a-day-off?sd=pf) have done an awesome job of turning it into a pirate-themed **educational tool using chatbot technology**. (Don‚Äôt worry, you can learn about anything, not just pirates.)

Enter a topic of your choice and, after a few mins, a list of chapters gets displayed and you can work through them. After each chapter it offers quiz questions, you can go back and forth between sections, and it saves the output to a web page. I asked it to teach me about String Theory and it did a *great* job. (Although it still sounds like gibberish.)

**[Encord.com](https://encord.com/): Label, curate, and debug your training data. All in one platform (Sponsor)**

Forget about fragmented tools and notebooks for creating your active learning pipelines. Encord is a single integrated platform that makes it quicker and easier to **build production computer vision models** using active learning pipelines. Encord helps you streamline your machine learning projects, giving you a single platform for labeling any visual data, managing annotators, improving training data quality and debugging your datasets and models.
