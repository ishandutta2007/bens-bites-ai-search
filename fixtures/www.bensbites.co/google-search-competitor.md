It's Fridayyyy thennnn...it's Saturday, Sunday what am I doing writing that in here ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Welcome to the 114 new folks joining us from yesterday.

Tonight's menu will be Lobster cocktail + Crispy wings (shared w/ my wife because she always makes me share), Dirty Burger or Cote de Boeuf or Satay Curry (I'm torn), and Mango cheesecake. Food coma, a glass of wine or 4, then bed. Bada Bing. Bada Boom.

Have an indulgent weekend, let's get to it.

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:
