Hey folks, ü•≥ü•≥ we just crossed **100k subscribers** 10 minutes ago. Huge thanks to all of you.

Let‚Äôs get to the good stuff, then. Today we‚Äôve got more updates from Google, including MedPaLM 2, AI in advertising and code generation in Google Colab. Add in Stability AI launching an open-source version of their commercial AI art platform.

psss: Our NYC meetup, along with TheGP and Betaworks, is on the 22nd May. Excited to meet some of you there.

**A new way to write software**

[Diffblue Cover](https://www.diffblue.com/?utm_campaign=Newsletter%20ads\&utm_source=bens-bites\&utm_medium=email) is the world‚Äôs first generative AI solution that autonomously writes code at scale.

It uses reinforcement learning to create and maintain entire Java unit test suites. Cover can write tens of thousands of tests without human input - for **better software and more productive developers.**

Hey, it‚Äôs getting a bit Google-heavy now, but not my fault: they‚Äôre gaining momentum right now! We had Google I/O‚Äôs onslaught of consumer releases last week, and there are some new updates from them.

- [A state-of-the-art medical AI advisor](https://twitter.com/alan_karthi/status/1658732728655699969)

Smashing**state-of-the-arts in medical AI**,**MedPaLM-2**doesn‚Äôt only have a 19% performance improvement over MedPaLM, but**physicians also preferred its responses**to other physicians. (Maybe there‚Äôs just a bit of industry rivalry going on there‚Ä¶) More importantly, general public users also find it consistently more helpful. The trajectory of progress here is seriously impressive, and these guys might be radically changing the field of medical advice.

- [Sneaking generative AI into their advertising revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/google-to-use-new-ai-models-for-ads-and-to-help-youtube-creators.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-gonna-keep-the-ball-rolling)

It‚Äôs also time for**Google**to get down and dirty with the real revenue generators, and it‚Äôs hardly a surprise they‚Äôre sneaking generative AI into it. They wanna use it to automate**advertising**and ad-supported consumer services on things like YouTube; allowing advertisers to generate their own media assets and suggest videos for YouTubers to show. Tune into their 23rd May Google Marketing Live to hear all their money-spinning updates.

- [Google Colab is about to get its own code generation AI](https://blog.google/technology/developers/google-colab-ai-coding-features/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-gonna-keep-the-ball-rolling)

**Colab**, their Jupyter notebook-style coding environment, will be getting some**AI coding features**. Things like**code completions**, prompt-based code generation, and an assistant chatbot. They have a model called**Codey**, specifically built for code generation, and it‚Äôs done perfectly to sit in Colab and smash out some Python for you.

[Stability AI release an open-source version of their commercial AI art platform](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/17/23726751/stability-ai-stablestudio-dreamstudio-stable-diffusion-artificial-intelligence?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-gonna-keep-the-ball-rolling)

**Stability AI**seems to be taking heed to the chatter recently that open-source AI is going to provide a seriously legitimate challenge to Big Tech. So much so that they‚Äôve created an open-source product to compete with‚Ä¶ their own commercial product.**StableStudio**is an open-source version of**DreamStudio**, their commercial AI art platform. They‚Äôll be able to reap the rewards of the open source community contributing to improve the platform, whilst also offering customisable services in DreamStudio. Despite the nice-sounding set up, it does beg the question of how it might impact one of their only cash generators.
