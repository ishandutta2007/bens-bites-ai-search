Hey friends!

I'm getting into a good groove with this email now (although tomorrow will be a challenge as I'm off to a wedding from 9 am üò¨). In future, I'd like to make sure it gets into your inbox at a consistent time, around 9 am ET.

Let me know what you think of today's email while I sit inside to avoid the pissing rain here in the UK. (so make it nice - you always do üòò)

Let's get to it!

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

üí¨ Open-source speech-to-speech translation\
üìù A GPT-3 alternative\
üõ† A new tool for building LLM apps\
üé∂ Text-to-music is here

## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

- Facebook Meta [has released](https://twitter.com/MetaAI/status/1582776841001000960) the **first AI-powered speech-to-speech translation** system for a primarily oral language, translating Hokkien (a variety of Chinese), one of primaly spoken languages. You can use a demo [on Hugging Face here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/facebook/speech_matrix) and [read the full blog post here](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/ai-translation-hokkien/). Also, they‚Äôve [open-sourced the code](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/ust) !!

- GPT-3 (from OpenAI) is the main text-based model out there, and it‚Äôs not open source. [CarperAI](https://carper.ai/) (of Stability AI) is partnering with Humanloop, Scale and Hugging Face to bring **an open-source alternative to GPT-3**. They [outline](https://twitter.com/humanloop/status/1582895644863131648?s=12\&t=iwbZMG10T9uRxjqRkE3IEA) why it‚Äôs a big deal (and it is a BIG deal). CarperAI will release a chinchilla-optimal large language model explicitly trained to follow human instructions .

- Lex, the largely hyped AI-writing tool has been releasing invites (I‚Äôm writing in it now) and [**Justin filmed a reaction video**](https://twitter.com/mijustin/status/1582522275542487040) as he‚Äôs using it to write a blog post. It‚Äôs a really great demo of how it all works AND feels to use some of this technology.

- We‚Äôve all been thinking about **pseudonymity-preserving meetups,** haven‚Äôt we?! No? Well, thankfully Balaji has. Who else?! It‚Äôs a way to essentially meet in person while still hiding your identity and speech. A bit of a wild futuristic concept, but [there‚Äôs a partial demo of it.](https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1582712658825924609)

- [**Generalizing in the real world with representation learning**](https://twitter.com/tegan_maharaj/status/1582767165307879428). Essentially this says that there are several assumptions and problem settings which fail to generalise to the real world. So this paper proposes ways to address those failures.

- **[How reliable is GPT-3?](https://twitter.com/ChengleiSi/status/1582473478543794177)** (Hint: it can be more reliable than you think!)

- [This short thread](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1582807367988654081) discusses **what a Transformer is**. Pretty useful!

- [This team train **diffusion models with strict differential privacy guarantees**](https://twitter.com/timudk/status/1582717593718181891) and outperformed previous methods by large margins.

üëã Too many links?! I created a database for all links mentioned in these emails. Refer 2 friends [using this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER) and I'll send over the link database.

- OpenAI is [running a Hackathon for Climate Change](https://openai.com/hackathon/): how our current **AI models can accelerate solutions to climate change.**

- **A [form builder](https://fillout.com/) with AI built in**. Watch the demo using AI [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXkQ-WobvOM). This was built by a Ben's Bites reader, [Dominic](https://twitter.com/domwhyte42).

- [Dust](https://dust.tt/) is a new tool that helps you **design and deploy Large Language Model apps**. In [their announcement](https://twitter.com/dust4ai/status/1582769638282100747), they show off a demo of how it works.
