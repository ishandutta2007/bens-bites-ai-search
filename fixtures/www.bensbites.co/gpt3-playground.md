## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

- **[A playground for GPT-3](https://www.everyprompt.com/);** folders, team support, and more. If you store your prompts in your notes like me, now you can use Every Prompt. I‚Äôve been a beta tester and spoke with the founders - you should check it out.

- Review pull requests, automatically. \*\*[Your AI-powered code review assistant](http://whatthediff.ai/),\*\*What The Diff.

- **Upload a paper ‚Üí get an explanation**. [Explainpaper](http://explainpaper.com/) (mentioned previously) has now released a way to upload any paper and get an explanation and ask for follow-ups. Finally, I can pretend to better understand all these research papers now!

- Scale (a huge data AI company) **[hosted a virtual conference and got a ton of big names to speak all about AI](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAHS4cP-uIXdrpCsSfGq_OA/videos)**. You can now view [all of the recordings here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAHS4cP-uIXdrpCsSfGq_OA/videos). Some notable speakers include; [Eric Schmidt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gn-9SRkJazs), [Nat Friedman](https://youtu.be/lnufceCxwG0), [Emad Mostaque](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k124oUlY_6g), [Greg Brockman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp3A5q9L_bg) and [Mike Schroepfer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_CxOBpn-mlM).

- I tried very hard to watch and summarise **[this fireside chat (Emad Mostaque, CEO of Stability.AI - Hosted by Elad Gil)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESDeUi8Yl-8)**, but the bloody builders thought it was a great idea to drill and cut all morning. And I've got a funeral to attend so instead, here's a list of topics they discussed; \*Stability.AIs journey \*Stable Diffusion and Generative Models \*Image gen use cases & startup opportunities \*Other types of generative models \*Open source & AI - what does the world look like in 5 years? \*AI safety \*Global AI. .

- **Google‚Äôs former CEO Eric Schmidt** was appointed to the National Security Commission on AI. He made direct investments in AI startups. There‚Äôs**no indication that he did anything wrong** but [government ethics advisors say his investments presented a huge conflict of interest.](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/24/how-googles-former-ceo-eric-schmidt-helped-write-ai-laws-in-washington-without-publicly-disclosing-investments-in-ai-start-ups.html)

- **[Behind the scenes](https://twitter.com/paultrillo/status/1584543033449533441) of that crazy video with masks, and effects** using Runway that I wrote about last week.

üëã Too many links?! I created a database for all links mentioned in these emails. Refer 1 friend [using this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER) and I'll send over the link database.

- **[GPT-3 creating both sides of an Interactive Fiction transcript](https://www.reddit.com/r/interactivefiction/comments/ycf8ol/gpt3_does_an_astonishingly_good_job_creating_both/).**

- **Bumble [open-sourced its AI that detects unsolicited nudes](https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/24/bumble-open-sourced-its-ai-that-detects-unsolicited-nudes/?guccounter=1)**. I wonder if they got that bug fixed which meant I never got any matches?

- **[The Value Of Artificial Intelligence Isn‚Äôt Just Insights](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joemckendrick/2022/10/25/the-value-of-artificial-intelligence-isnt-just-insights/).**

- Making sure robots don‚Äôt bump into each other (in factories etc), is a core building block. **[This model can generate collision-free, smooth motion](https://mpinets.github.io/)** from just a single depth camera observation.

- Sequoia has (quickly) **updated its Gen AI market map**. [Here‚Äôs a V2](https://twitter.com/sonyatweetybird/status/1584580362339962880). They‚Äôre also **hosting AI office hours** which you can sign up for [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSenbhM2l1n4DJvKmY4pZbqU2B-2CFguQEMvgHRt3gqE575UTw/viewform?usp=send_form).

- \[Por]TrAIts: AI Characters + Their Microstories \[Book 1] [has been released](https://mezbreeze.itch.io/portraits-volume-one). It‚Äôs **a fusion of AI-generated art and microstories** written in the English/code-hybrid language termed Mezangelle. Created by a human and DALL-E.

- **Speech to image using Stable Diffusion and Whisper**. [Demo on HF](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fffiloni/speech-to-image), [code on GitHub](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/tree/main/examples/community#speech-to-image).

- **[A letter to Mark Zuckerberg and the Meta Board](https://medium.com/@alt.cap/time-to-get-fit-an-open-letter-from-altimeter-to-mark-zuckerberg-and-the-meta-board-of-392d94e80a18)**. Brad believes the future is AI and Meta should get after it, but also keep the spending ‚Äòreasonable‚Äô ($20-25Bn) üò≥.

- The form tool with AI baked in (mentioned last week), has posted a **[‚Äòhow-to‚Äô guide for using AI to improve user onboarding](https://fillout.com/blog/how-we-used-ai-to-improve-our-user-onboarding/)** as they did.

- Wanna know what kinds of **biases are hidden in your large language model**? [Hugging Face has made some tools to help!](https://huggingface.co/blog/evaluating-llm-bias)

- Lachy Groom has created [bleeding edge](https://bleedingedge.ai/)‚Äî**a feed of noteworthy developments in AI.**

- [**Compositionality in language is important**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03575). However, many phrases aren't semantically compositional. How do language models deal with this? Moreover, how do humans deal with this?

- FreeCodeCamp has released a course "**[The basics of Machine Learning](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/free-machine-learning-course-10-hourse/)"**.

- [Sam Lessin wrote a screenshot essay](https://twitter.com/lessin/status/1584572317270568961) on **‚ÄúWhy you should be ‚Äòdefault out‚Äô on investing in ‚ÄòGenerative AI‚Äô companies for the next few years.‚Äù** - I like to throw in some against-the-grain points every now and then. And Sam makes some good ones here.

- An official **[Stable Diffusion API](https://stablediffusionapi.com/)**.
