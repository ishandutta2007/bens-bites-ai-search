DeviantArt introduced its new tool: [**DreamUp, a new tool to generate art**](https://www.deviantart.com/team/journal/Create-your-own-AI-generated-art-with-DreamUp-933537821).

The community kicked up a big fuss, and now "all deviations are automatically labelled as NOT authorized for use in AI datasets".
