**[GPT-4 is here](https://openai.com/research/gpt-4)**

Laaadiies, Gentlemen, and robots, it‚Äôs the moment you‚Äôve all been waiting for‚Ä¶**Enter GPT-4**, the long-awaited update to the model underlying ChatGPT! It has come with lots of ‚Äòmind-blown‚Äô emojis over its**additional performance quality**, disappointment about OpenAI‚Äôs**lack of transparency**, and the ability to involve both images and text - known as\*\*‚Äòmultimodality‚Äô\*\*. It even came with a[developer live stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=outcGtbnMuQ\&t=3272s)on YouTube.

According to OpenAI, GPT-4 has hit its**best results yet**on factuality, steerability, and keeping within guidelines. It‚Äôs even taken ChatGPT from being in the 10th percentile to the 90th percentile on the bar, as well as drastic improvements on many other human exams. Beyond the much-expected language improvements, it can generate responses to prompts and documents**that include images**- all whilst maintaining similar skills.

For those who have played around with prompting, you will probably have found that ‚Äòsteering‚Äô the AI towards behaving in a specified style has ended up producing the best results. This is the\*\*‚Äòsteerability‚Äô\*\*side of the model, and according to the team, GPT-4 is far more attuned to being steered. Wicked.

However, beyond all the excitement is a slight**air of disappointment**floating around the research community on[Twitter](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1635700579543416835?s=46\&t=or3yrprJGYA_h7PReQNTSw), and it‚Äôs to do with transparency. True - OpenAI hasn‚Äôt expanded on much in their formal publication, mostly using competition and AI safety as their reasoning for keeping almost every detail of the model behind closed doors. You could write a book on this discussion, although if AI safety was*really*a big concern, wouldn‚Äôt you just slow things down a bit? But hey - I‚Äôm not complaining!

**[Google drop their own generative AI tools, with inclusions in Google Docs](https://blog.google/technology/ai/ai-developers-google-cloud-workspace/)**

**Google**is like that dog that gets jealous when it sees you stroking another one. As soon as OpenAI dropped the GPT-4 bomb, they dropped their own slick new AI developer tool! Get a load of all of this. The**PaLM API**is their[upcoming tool](https://developers.googleblog.com/2023/03/announcing-palm-api-and-makersuite.html)that provides a way to build apps on top of their best language models; and they‚Äôve coupled it with**MakerSuite**, the sister tool to help with prototyping ideas and more. They‚Äôve also announced a bunch of new companies and tech partners‚Äô[training models with them](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/building-an-open-generative-ai-partner-ecosystem), including**Midjourney**!

But the coolest part of all of this is the inclusion of[generative AI within their workspace tools](https://workspace.google.com/blog/product-announcements/generative-ai)a.k.a**Google Docs**and Gmail. Type out a topic and it‚Äôll**generate a draft**, allowing you to adjust for tone and style too. Hold your horses though - it‚Äôs only available to ‚Äòtrusted‚Äô developers, so you‚Äôre gonna have to wait!

For the nitty-gritty developers out there, you‚Äôll probably be most interested in the[Generative AI App Builder](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/generative-ai-for-businesses-and-governments), which you can use to**build AI-powered chat interfaces**and digital assistants. Things are gonna get a whole lot easier!

**[Adept get a $350m funding round for their laptop-assistant AI vision](https://www.adept.ai/blog/series-b)**

Wow-eeeee that‚Äôs a[monster funding round](https://www.forbes.com/sites/kenrickcai/2023/03/14/adept-ai-startup-raises-350-million-series-b/)! Despite all the SVB mania, the tech industry is clearly still on a roll. At**Adept**, their vision is centred around**allowing AI to work with you**on your computer, letting it**develop with you**and execute operations for you at your request. This could allow your creativity and productivity to run wild. I‚Äôm imagining another mouse running around my computer with me. Maybe even multiple all at once working on two things at the same time‚Ä¶ The possibilities might be endless with a**wad of cash**that big.

**Have you checked out**\*\*[Content at Scale](https://contentatscale.ai/?utm_source=newsletter\&utm_medium=email\&utm_campaign=bensbytes)\*\*\*\*?? (Sponsor)\*\*

With this new technology you can upload a list of up to 100 keywords and within minutes get 100 entire blog posts (2,600+ words!) written. It's so human-like it's actually not AI-detectable, saving you against future Google updates.

No more waiting around or wasting time on copywriting yourself‚Äîit's not one of these regular AI writers.[Definitely worth checking out.](https://contentatscale.ai/?utm_source=newsletter\&utm_medium=email\&utm_campaign=bensbytes)
