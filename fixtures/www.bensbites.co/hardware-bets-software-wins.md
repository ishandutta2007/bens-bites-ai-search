Hey folks, this is Ben‚Äôs Bites. Yesterday I tried to send this from our custom domain and I f\*cked it up üòÖ. Can you reply and let me know if this email reached your inbox ok? ‚ù§Ô∏è

Today we talk about how Microsoft put skin in the AI game and is now reaping the benefits, laying off its AI ethics team, how AI is changing everything and using Meta‚Äôs LLaMa on Google Colab.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

**1/**

[Microsoft spent hundreds of millions on hardware to get ahead in AI](https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/13/23637675/microsoft-chatgpt-bing-millions-dollars-supercomputer-openai)

**OpenAI**really hit the jackpot when they decided to pitch the need for ridiculous amounts of**computing power**[back in 2015](https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/ai/how-microsofts-bet-on-azure-unlocked-an-ai-revolution/). And**Microsoft**really hit it out of the park when they decided to say yes. Since then, Microsoft have reportedly spent**hundreds of millions on thousands of NVIDIA GPUs**and new ways to build hardware at a scale never seen before. All rooted in the conviction that all this computing power would one-day yield results in the form of the first truly spectacular AI machines. And here we are in 2023, with**ChatGPT**shortly followed by**Bing\*\*\*\*AI**, an absolute overload of hugely useful tools, and a decent chance that the world is about to change‚Ä¶ Jeez, I think I need to chill out a bit.

**2/**

**[AI changes everything](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/12/opinion/chatbots-artificial-intelligence-future-weirdness.html)**

We tend to overestimate\*\*how long it will take AI to ‚Äòunrecognisably transform the world‚Äô.\*\*It‚Äôs likely to be years, not decades, and there‚Äôs a real chance its months. Are developers too close to the tech? Do we understand what we‚Äôre building towards? Can we even go slower? Or do we need to adapt faster? This piece is an interesting look at some of the questions swirling around a lot of our minds.

**3/**

[Meta‚Äôs LLaMa 4-bit works on the free Google Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtAZHHyJSqU)

There‚Äôs nothing quite like a short**tutorial**to move something from being quite complicated to a lot less so, and[this guy](https://twitter.com/1littlecoder)always pulls a rabbit out of the hat with his ones. Over the past few days, we‚Äôve come to realise how big**Meta‚Äôs LlaMa model**might be for democratising the use of powerful language models, and this tutorial takes us through using it within the free version of**Google Colab**- a Jupyter notebook-style interface on the cloud that allows limited use of GPUs. In bitesize steps, it takes you through setting up your Colab, downloading the Llama model code, and running it on a sample dataset. (In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, I still don‚Äôt quite know which letters to uppercase in llama‚Ä¶)

**4/**

[Microsoft just laid off one of its responsible AI teams](https://www.platformer.news/p/microsoft-just-laid-off-one-of-its)

Microsoft's recent **layoff of its entire AI ethics and society team** has raised concerns about the potential risks posed by the company's AI products. The move has left Microsoft without a dedicated team to ensure that AI principles are linked to product design, although the company still has an Office of Responsible AI. Employees are worried that the absence of a dedicated team may lead to products not being designed with responsible principles in mind.
