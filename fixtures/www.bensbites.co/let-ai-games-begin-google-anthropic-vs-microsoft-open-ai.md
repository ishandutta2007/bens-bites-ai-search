### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Google invests $300m in Anthropic, creators of the Claude chatbot**](https://www.ft.com/content/583ead66-467c-4bd5-84d0-ed5df7b5bf9c)

It‚Äôs hard to call a multi-billion dollar company an underdog, but **Microsoft** is giving me that feeling I got watching Morocco get to the semi-final of the World Cup last year. And I‚Äôm a sucker for an underdog! So with **Google‚Äôs $300m investment in Anthropic** hitting headlines, stirring excitement about a potential **chatbot search engine**, I *kiiiinda*low-key hope Bing pips them and comes out the winner!

Paywall removed [**here**](https://archive.is/ciZPV).

**2/**

[**A preview of Microsoft‚Äôs Bing with an AI chatbot**](https://medium.com/@owenyin/scoop-oh-the-things-youll-do-with-bing-s-chatgpt-62b42d8d7198)

Speaking of **chatbot search engines**and Microsoft, this post gives readers a sneak peek at the chatbot Microsoft will be incorporating into **Bing**(apparently - Microsoft have no comment of course), using **OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4** technology. It‚Äôll have a 1000-character prompt box, responses that can be personally tailored, references, and conversational abilities like ChatGPT. This could be the start of a **major shift** in how we find information online. Will it also mark a shift in the company we use to do it?

**3/**

[**Quora‚Äôs new chatbot AI called Poe**](https://twitter.com/adamdangelo/status/1621544019930279936?s=20\&t=yxf6onEDSoVv04Ka95LufA)

**Quora** is now doing more than providing a website that consumes me for hours, reading about things I didn‚Äôt even know I found interesting. They‚Äôve just released **Poe**. Sitting as an iPhone app (with plans for Android and a web experience soon), it has a slick messaging interface, is actually **much** **faster than ChatGPT** for me, provides suggested follow-up prompts, clickable topics to go further down the rabbit hole and has multiple different bots with cute little names. Don't let their cuteness fool you, they are different models - Sage is from OpenAI, Heron is from Anthropic and Dragonfly is another OpenAI model.

I spoke with the Quora founder about the app and there's a lot more to come that I wasn't allowed to see üëÄ . They're betting that people will want the ability to choose which models they interact with.

**4/**

**[Lex, the AI writing tool, is evolving.](https://click.convertkit-mail2.com/xmurpe093lt6hr7d83zs5/dpheh0hqx353wdfm/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cueW91dHViZS5jb20vd2F0Y2g_dj15MW1QRWMtLVVKSQ==)**

As of late last night, Lex now has AI suggestions when you highlight a string of text and comments (including saved draft comments). You can probably guess where that develops further with multiple options for different sentences etc.

Admittedly I just assumed Lex was a writing tool plus AI features, like most others, seem to be. But chatting with Nathan last night, it's really **becoming your writing collaborator**. It is thinking of the writing tool experience with AI baked in from the start. Imagine if AI was your first port of call to collaborate on your documents.
