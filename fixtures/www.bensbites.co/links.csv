To turn it on type --v 5 after your prompt or select ""V5"" from /settings

What's new with the V5 base model?
- Much wider stylistic range and more responsive to prompting
- Much higher image quality (2x resolution increase) improved dynamic range
- More detailed images. Details more likely to be correct. Less unwanted text.
- Improved performance with image prompting
- Supports --tile argument for seamless tiling (experimental)
- Supports --ar aspect ratios greater than 2:1 (experimental)
- Supports --iw for weighing image prompts versus text prompts

Style and prompting for V5
- Today’s test is basically a ‘pro’ mode of the model. 
- It’s MUCH more ‘unopinionated’ than v3 and v4, and is tuned to provide a wide diversity of outputs and to be very responsive to your inputs.
- The tradeoff here is that it may be harder to use. Short prompts may not work as well. You should try to write longer, more explicit text about what you want (ie: “cinematic photo with dramatic lighting”)",1littlecoder,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AI4zU5NTOtk,2023-03-16T06:57:39.000Z,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpV_X0VrL8-jg3t6wYGS-1g,New Image & Speech capabilities,2023-03-16T09:06:17Z,4152f398-49db-415d-8aa3-35848b05a77f,https://www.bensbites.co/p/new-image-speech-capabilities

link,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CnAgB3A5OlU,Chat in LangChain - #5,YouTube,"With the advent of OpenAI's Chat-GPT API endpoint (ChatCompletion), LangChain quickly added support for the new endpoint. Unlike previous LLM endpoints, the chat endpoint takes multiple inputs and so has its own unique set of objects and methods.

OpenAI's `ChatCompletion` endpoint consumes three types of input:

- System message — this acts as an initial prompt to ""setup"" the behavior of the chat completion.
- Human messages — these are human prompts (both current and past) that are fed into the model.
- AI messages — past AI responses to the human prompts.

The prior `Completion` endpoint used for other models, like OpenAI's `text-davinci-003`, only accepted a single `input` field. In `input`, we would write everything.

Because of this difference, we now have the LangChain `ChatOpenAI` object alongside several new prompt templates and ""message"" objects. We'll explore how these are used in this chapter.

About Generally Intelligent
We started Generally Intelligent because we believe that software with human-level intelligence will have a transformative impact on the world. We’re dedicated to ensuring that that impact is a positive one.

We have enough funding to freely pursue our research goals over the next decade, and our backers include Y Combinator, researchers from OpenAI, Astera Institute, and a number of private individuals who care about effective altruism and scientific research.

Our research is focused on agents for digital environments (ex: browser, desktop, documents), using RL, large language models, and self supervised learning. We’re excited about opportunities to use simulated data, network architecture search, and good theoretical understanding of deep learning to make progress on these problems. We take a focused, engineering-driven approach to research.

LangChain is a framework that makes it easier to build scalable AI/LLM apps. Supabase is an open source Postgres database that can store embeddings using a pg vector extension.

We'll discuss the process of extracting relevant data from website links,  ""embedding"" the vectors using Openai's embedding function, storing the embeddings in Supabase, and querying(asking a question) to 'chat' with your website data.

Whether you run or work for a business (or personal brand), you know how important it is to connect with your audiences/customers in a timely manner as soon as they interact with your brand/website (otherwise they will bounce).   

Chatbots give your brand/website a fighting chance of connecting with your ideal audience by creating a personalized, interactive, and immediate response to their questions. 24/7 whether you're there or not.

We use hybrid search with sentence transformers and SPLADE for medical quesiton-answering. By using hybrid search we're able to search using both dense and sparse vectors. This allows us to cover semantics with the dense vectors, and features like exact matching and keyword search with the sparse vectors.

For the sparse vectors we use SPLADE. SPLADE is the first sparse embedding method to outperform BM25 across a variety of tasks. It's an incredibly powerful technique that enables the typical sparse search advantages while also enabling learning term expansion to help minimize the vocabulary mismatch problem.

The demo we work through here uses SPLADE and a sentence transformer model trained on MS-MARCO. These are all implemented via Hugging Face transformers.

Finally, for the search component we use the Pinecone vector database. The only vector DB at the time of writing that natively supports SPLADE vectors.

No matter what business you're in, knowledge is your most important asset and competitive advantage. 

Notion is a powerful workspace that helps teams and individuals to stay productive. A notion knowledge base is a library of thoughts (a second brain) or important information for your team and customers, if you're an organization. It is designed to save valuable time spent searching for answers to basic questions. 

The problem is that valuable knowledge often gets lost in the weeds. We have little patience or time to ""look"" for information. Luckily, with the advancement of technology with openai's GPT-3 and LangChain's framework, we can create simple notion chatbots that can do the heavy lifting for us and search all the docs for relevant answers to our questions.

First, you'll learn how to export your Notion knowledge base, ""ingest"" it (including creating embeddings using OpenAI Embedding API), and then index those embeddings in the Pinecone vector database for fast and scalable vector search.

Then, we'll chain the pieces together using LangChain: a powerful framework that abstracts the complexities of this process and makes it easier to build semantic search, question-answering, threat-detection, and other applications that rely on NLP and search over a large corpus of text data.

You can review and use the notion chatbot starter code on github (link below).

Enjoy.

link,http://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu,Diffusion Policy: Visuomotor Policy Learning via Action Diffusion,,"This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot's visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 12 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models.",,,,https://diffusion-policy.cs.columbia.edu/,,,"Business in the AI era ",2023-03-08T09:54:33Z,9bcad98e-d898-4f0f-8cae-858d89a53ae5,https://www.bensbites.co/p/business-relationships-ai-era

link,https://youtu.be/gTkupawAG6w,ARTEMIS: Advanced Robotic Technology for Enhanced Mobility and Improved Stability,YouTube,"ARTEMIS Humanoid Robot

• ARTEMIS (Advanced Robotic Technology for Enhanced Mobility and Improved Stability) is a full-sized humanoid robot developed at RoMeLa (Robotics & Mechanisms Laboratory) at UCLA, designed from ground up for highly dynamic locomotion with new technical innovations.
• ARTEMIS is being developed as a “general-purpose humanoid,” with a focus on studying dynamic bipedal locomotion on unstructured environments.
• ARTEMIS is also being developed as a soccer player robot for the autonomous robot soccer competition, RoboCup. The official goal of RoboCup is to have a team of robots play against the human WorldCup champions and win by the year 2050. RoMeLa is a 5-time World Champion in RoboCup.

Notable Performances:
• ARTEMIS can walk up to 2.1 m/s (fastest walking humanoid robot in the world s far as we know)
• ARTEMIS can walk on uneven, rough, unstructured terrain - can walk on a rubble pile with randomly scattered wooden planks, blocks and boxes, etc.
• ARTEMIS is very robust against external disturbances - can balance even when pushed or kicked ‘very strongly.’
• ARTEMIS can run (with a flight phase with both feet off the ground). She is first humanoid robot in academia that can run, and the 3rd in the world as far as we know.
• ARTEMIS can jump with a ‘significant air phase.’
• ARTEMIS operates untethered, with all power (battery) and computations (computers) onboard.

Notable Technical Innovations:
• ARTEMIS uses custom designed torque-controlled, “proprioceptive actuators” (vs position-controlled servo motors) which behaves more like biological muscles. This enables it to make it run and walk on uneven terrain.
• ARTEMIS is 100% electromechanical actuation.

Additional Technical Innovations:
• Topology optimization-based structure design, analysis and manufacturing.
• Unconventional hip orientation for better torque distribution between yaw and roll actuators.
• Optimized inertia for dynamic locomotion: Minimize distal mass, Relocate actuators using linkages.
• Robust touchdown sensing: New type of front and back single-axis foot force sensor that replaces the conventional fragile F/T sensors. Overload protected.

ARTEMIS Specification:
• Height: 1.42 m
• Weight (mass): 37 kg
• 20 Degree of Freedom (DoF)
⁃ 5 DoF per leg
⁃ 4 DoF per arm
⁃ 2 DoF neck
• Actuators: custom designed torque-controlled proprioceptive actuators
• Power: x4 100Wh Lithium battery
• Sensors
⁃ x1 ZED 2i stereo camera
⁃ x2 RealSense D435i
⁃ x1 Microstrain IMU
⁃ x2 Custom foot loadcell

Fun facts:
• ARTEMIS is considered female (In ancient Greek religion and mythology, Artemis is the goddess of chastity, hunting, and the moon)
• Officially, ARTEMIS stands for “Advanced Robotic Technology for Enhanced Mobility and Improved Stability”
• Internally, ARTEMIS stands for “A Robot That Exceeds Messi In Soccer”
• ARTEMIS wears regular shoes made for human, and she wears size 4. ARTEMIS prefers #Nike. #justdoit
• ARTEMIS is partially funded by ONR (Office of Naval Research) and funds raised by a successful UCLA Spark Fund campaign.  
• ARTEMIS will be participating in the Adult size Humanoid division for RoboCup 2023 in Bordeaux, France July 4-10, 2023. She shall bring the converted “Louis Vuitton” trophy to the United States by becoming World Champions. (RoMeLa is a 5-times World Champions in RoboCup)
• ARTEMIS will be taking regular bi-weekly strolls on UCLA campus to meet and inspire students in STEM. ARTEMIS will also be practicing her soccer skills on the UCLA Intramural Playing Field starting this Spring.

While NeRF-based techniques excel at representing fine geometric structures with smoothly varying view-dependent appearance, they often fail to accurately capture and reproduce the appearance of glossy surfaces. We address this limitation by introducing Ref-NeRF, which replaces NeRF's parameterization of view-dependent outgoing radiance with a representation of reflected radiance and structures this function using a collection of spatially-varying scene properties. We show that together with a regularizer on normal vectors, our model significantly improves the realism and accuracy of specular reflections. Furthermore, we show that our model's internal representation of outgoing radiance is interpretable and useful for scene editing.",,,,https://ziyang-xie.github.io/s-nerf/,,,ChatGPT API is here and it's 10X cheaper,2023-03-02T09:43:47Z,5b34860e-4022-4309-b950-af0365112ef1,https://www.bensbites.co/p/chatgpt-api-10x-cheaper

link,https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/scale-ai-why-data-will-power-the-ai-revolution/,Scale AI: Why Data Will Power the AI Revolution | Index Ventures,Index Ventures,"Scale AI emerged from a fairly small-stakes problem. Alexandr Wang, its 26-year-old founder and CEO, wanted to know when to restock his fridge.Wang grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, the son of two physicists working at the national lab in town. That upbringing helped spark his interest in science and technology. In high school, he excelled in math, physics, and coding competitions, and worked for two tech companies. In 2015, he enrolled at MIT to study computer science, where he received perfect grades in his first year. But he had that grocery problem. He decided to code his way out of it.Wang could see that artificial intelligence and machine learning were transforming the world. “First we built machines that could do arithmetic,” he says, “but the idea that you could have them do these more nuanced tasks that required what we view as humanlike understanding was this very exciting technological concept.” He looked around for a side project and decided to build a camera inside his fridge that would tell him if he was running low on milk.After a few weeks, he realized there was no way he’d get enough data to train his system to properly quantify his fridge’s contents. A realization struck him. He envisioned AI over the next 20 years. “We’re going to build incredible things with AI,” he says. “What are the hurdles? It became really clear that data was going to be one of those.” That’s when he came up with Scale, what he calls “data infrastructure to power the AI revolution.”""First we built machines that could do arithmetic, but the idea that you could have them do these more nuanced tasks that required what we view as humanlike understanding was this very exciting technological concept.""— Alex Wang, Scale AIWang dropped out of MIT after a year and joined the tech accelerator Y Combinator with a small team. They couldn’t power the AI revolution singlehandedly, so they narrowed their efforts to a use case that had captured the world’s attention: autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars need to learn to recognize pedestrians, stop lights, other cars, and more. They can’t do it on their own; they need humans to label images for them so they can learn by example. Scale recruited humans to do the labeling for car companies, so the companies could train their AI on those images.To build their business, Scale needed to get in front of clients’ faces. So they traveled to Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), a big AI conference. “We would be super scrappy,” Wang says. “We’d go from booth to booth with a laptop with a demo on it.” The gambit worked. “And then as we grew, it became more applicable to other industries of AI, whether that’s for satellite data, or e-commerce data, or large internet companies, or insurance companies, or U.S. government organizations.”Zhichun Li, one of Scale’s first employees, recalls a big client meeting in the South Bay. She and two other employees were all young, like Wang, and wore backpacks. Someone commented that it looked like a field trip. “It was just funny how you bring in a small group of very young, talented people and hand them this problem,” she says. “And we’re just going to solve it.”",,,,https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/scale-ai-why-data-will-power-the-ai-revolution/,,,Record-speed AI images,2023-02-24T08:39:53Z,c5dd5a65-fa5e-4156-8b31-89069227384a,https://www.bensbites.co/p/recordspeed-ai-images

link,https://zju3dv.github.io/instant_nvr/,Learning Neural Volumetric Representations of Dynamic Humans in Minutes,,"This paper addresses the challenge of quickly reconstructing free-viewpoint videos of dynamic humans from sparse multi-view videos.     Some recent works represent the dynamic human as a canonical neural radiance field (NeRF) and a motion field, which are learned from videos through differentiable rendering. They generally require a lengthy optimization process.     Other generalization methods leverage learned prior from datasets and reduce the optimization time by only finetuning on new scenes at the cost of visual fidelity.     In this paper, we propose a novel method for creating viewpoint-free human performance synthesis from sparse view videos in minutes with competitive visual quality.     Specifically, we leverage the human body prior to define a novel part-based voxelized NeRF representation, which distributes the representational power of the canonical human model efficiently.     Furthermore, we propose a novel dimensionality reduction 2D motion parameterization scheme to increase the convergence rate of the human deformation field.     Experiments demonstrate that our approach can be trained 100 times faster than prior per-scene optimization methods while being competitive in the rendering quality. We show that given a 512x512 video capturing a human performer of 100 frames, our model typically takes about 5 minutes for training to produce photorealistic free-viewpoint videos on a single RTX 3090 GPU. The code will be released for reproducibility.",,,,https://chen-geng.com/instant_nvr,,,Record-speed AI images,2023-02-24T08:39:53Z,c5dd5a65-fa5e-4156-8b31-89069227384a,https://www.bensbites.co/p/recordspeed-ai-images

link,http://roboninja.cs.columbia.edu,RoboNinja: Learning an Adaptive Cutting Policy for Multi-Material Objects,,"We introduce RoboNinja, a learning-based cutting system for multi-material objects (i.e., soft objects with rigid cores such as avocados or mangos). In contrast to prior works using open-loop cutting actions to cut through single-material objects (e.g., slicing a cucumber), RoboNinja aims to remove the soft part of an object while preserving the rigid core, thereby maximizing the yield. To achieve this, our system closes the perception-action loop by utilizing an interactive state estimator and an adaptive cutting policy. The system first employs sparse collision information to iteratively estimate the position and geometry of an object's core and then generates closed-loop cutting actions based on the estimated state and a tolerance value. The adaptiveness of the policy is achieved through the tolerance value, which modulates the policy's conservativeness when encountering collisions, maintaining an adaptive safety distance from the estimated core. Learning such cutting skills directly on a real-world robot is challenging. Yet, existing simulators are limited in simulating multi-material objects or computing the energy consumption during the cutting process. To address this issue, we develop a differentiable cutting simulator that supports multi-material coupling and allows for the generation of optimized trajectories as demonstrations for policy learning. Furthermore, by using a low-cost force sensor to capture collision feedback, we were able to successfully deploy the learned model in real-world scenarios, including objects with diverse core geometries and soft materials.",,,,https://roboninja.cs.columbia.edu/,,,Tiktok for text is here,2023-02-23T09:35:36Z,668240db-aec0-4579-a934-b48e12b32385,https://www.bensbites.co/p/tiktok-text

We wanted to do an episode on AI… and we went deep down the rabbit hole. As we went down, we discussed ChatGPT and the new generation of AI, digital superintelligence, the end of humanity, and if there’s anything we can do to survive.

This conversation with Eliezer Yudkowsky sent us into an existential crisis, with the primary claim that we are on the cusp of developing AI that will destroy humanity. 

Be warned before diving into this episode, dear listener. Once you dive in, there’s no going back.

link,https://sungheonpark.github.io/tempinterpnerf/,Temporal Interpolation is All You Need for Dynamic Neural Radiance Fields,,"Temporal interpolation often plays a crucial role to learn meaningful representations in dynamic scenes. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train four-dimensional spatiotemporal neural radiance fields of dynamic scenes based on temporal interpolation of feature vectors. Two feature interpolation methods are suggested depending on underlying representations, neural or grid representation. In neural representation, we extract features from space-time inputs via multiple neural network modules and interpolate them based on time frames. The proposed multi-level feature interpolation network effectively captures features of both short-term and long-term time ranges. In grid representation, space-time features are learned via four-dimensional hash grids. The grid representation remarkably reduces training time, which is more than 100 times faster compared to the neural network models, while maintaining the rendering quality of trained models. Concatenation of static and dynamic features and addition of simple smoothness term further improves the performance of the proposed models. Despite the simplicity of its network architecture, we demonstrate that the proposed method shows superior performance to previous works in neural representation and shows the fastest training speed in grid representation.",,,,https://sungheonpark.github.io/tempinterpnerf/,,,AI to cure addiction,2023-02-21T07:42:12Z,3b1328a5-11c8-4367-893d-3293ded47c70,https://www.bensbites.co/p/ai-cure-addiction

I created this #musicvideo with images generated using #artificialintelligence by inputting the lyrics into #midjourney and then editing them over the track Rock Co.Kane Flow by De La Soul feat. MF DOOM.

I also created each lyric/line as a stand alone NFT collectible on OpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/rock-co-kane-flow

I set the floor of each collectible at 0.1eth. Each NFT is 1/1 and unlocks a .zip file of the images for that segment of the video.

But even this field is quickly shifting, especially with the advent of wide-scale AI. Today we get to chat with Amjad Masad, CEO and founder of Replit, about these foundational shifts.

We dive into how Replit has integrated AI into its platform and the implications on both current and future developers. It’s easier than ever to learn to code, but is it still worthwhile? And does the 10x engineer really exist? Listen in to find out.

These are key features in LangChain that act as the foundation behind more advanced langchain uses like conversational AI (chatbots), retrieval augmented ML, and more.

LangChain is a popular framework that allows users to quickly build apps and pipelines around Large Language Models. It integrates directly with OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 models and Hugging Face's open-source alternatives like Google's flan-t5 models.

It can be used for chatbots, Generative Question-Anwering (GQA), summarization, and much more.

The core idea of the library is that we can ""chain"" together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules. We'll explore all of this in these videos.

Of course, there’s a data-centric twist – some of the training data includes common problems faced in real-world data like undefined and undefined. You will find open-source tools like undefined, undefined, and undefined useful to achieve top performance and SaaS apps like undefined helpful for exploring and correcting the issues in the training data to improve your model, but you are encouraged to combine any tools you like with your expert data-science skills to find and/or correct issues in the training data to produce an improved model.In this DCAI competition, you will have to conquer two different data modalities - text (first 5 weeks of the competition) and images (second 5 weeks of the competition). For the first, you are given a dataset of reviews from Amazon with an associated ‘star’ rating. Your job is to build and optimize a classification model that predicts the star rating given a review. For the second, you are given a dataset of alpha-numeric character images. Your job is to build and optimize a classification model that predicts the character type given an image. The validation and test sets you will be evaluated against are drawn from the same distribution as the training data, but unlike the training data, are mostly free of outliers and label errors to ensure accurate evaluation of the real-world performance of your model (via the predictions you submit).You will have 5 weeks to complete each of the two competitions. The first will run from January 23rd to February 28th and the second will run from February 28th to March 21st. Over each of the 5 weeks, you will have access to the training data and validation data that we will use for the Public Leaderboard. On the final day of each competition, you will download the final test dataset and from that point have ONE HOUR to make your final predictions and submissions. Once the 1-hour timer runs out, you will no longer be able to make any submissions. DO NOT CLICK “Download the Final Test Dataset” BUTTON UNTIL YOU ARE READY TO DOWNLOAD THE FINAL TEST DATASET AND MAKE YOUR FINAL SUBMISSION.At the conclusion of the hackathon, you will have ONE DAY to submit your notebook and a pdf write-up of the methods you used in the competition. This submission is REQUIRED to win the prize money and be considered for the “Most Innovative” solution. You are still welcome to submit only predictions to get on the leaderboard but you will not be considered for any prizes if you do not submit your notebook (code) and pdf write-up. Timeline of the competition:undefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefinedundefined",,,,https://machinehack.com/tournaments/data_centric_ai_competition_2023,,,Chief AI Officer,2023-02-10T11:19:31Z,6fca5eed-9ea8-40e4-9d55-e75b7aa87dab,https://www.bensbites.co/p/chief-ai-officer

link,https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/scale-ai-why-data-will-power-the-ai-revolution/,Scale AI: Why Data Will Power the AI Revolution | Index Ventures,Index Ventures,"Scale AI emerged from a fairly small-stakes problem. Alexandr Wang, its 26-year-old founder and CEO, wanted to know when to restock his fridge.Wang grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico, the son of two physicists working at the national lab in town. That upbringing helped spark his interest in science and technology. In high school, he excelled in math, physics, and coding competitions, and worked for two tech companies. In 2015, he enrolled at MIT to study computer science, where he received perfect grades in his first year. But he had that grocery problem. He decided to code his way out of it.Wang could see that artificial intelligence and machine learning were transforming the world. “First we built machines that could do arithmetic,” he says, “but the idea that you could have them do these more nuanced tasks that required what we view as humanlike understanding was this very exciting technological concept.” He looked around for a side project and decided to build a camera inside his fridge that would tell him if he was running low on milk.After a few weeks, he realized there was no way he’d get enough data to train his system to properly quantify his fridge’s contents. A realization struck him. He envisioned AI over the next 20 years. “We’re going to build incredible things with AI,” he says. “What are the hurdles? It became really clear that data was going to be one of those.” That’s when he came up with Scale, what he calls “data infrastructure to power the AI revolution.”""First we built machines that could do arithmetic, but the idea that you could have them do these more nuanced tasks that required what we view as humanlike understanding was this very exciting technological concept.""— Alex Wang, Scale AIWang dropped out of MIT after a year and joined the tech accelerator Y Combinator with a small team. They couldn’t power the AI revolution singlehandedly, so they narrowed their efforts to a use case that had captured the world’s attention: autonomous vehicles. Self-driving cars need to learn to recognize pedestrians, stop lights, other cars, and more. They can’t do it on their own; they need humans to label images for them so they can learn by example. Scale recruited humans to do the labeling for car companies, so the companies could train their AI on those images.To build their business, Scale needed to get in front of clients’ faces. So they traveled to Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), a big AI conference. “We would be super scrappy,” Wang says. “We’d go from booth to booth with a laptop with a demo on it.” The gambit worked. “And then as we grew, it became more applicable to other industries of AI, whether that’s for satellite data, or e-commerce data, or large internet companies, or insurance companies, or U.S. government organizations.”Zhichun Li, one of Scale’s first employees, recalls a big client meeting in the South Bay. She and two other employees were all young, like Wang, and wore backpacks. Someone commented that it looked like a field trip. “It was just funny how you bring in a small group of very young, talented people and hand them this problem,” she says. “And we’re just going to solve it.”",,,,https://www.indexventures.com/perspectives/scale-ai-why-data-will-power-the-ai-revolution/,,,"Microsoft 1, Google 0 - A $100bn mistake",2023-02-09T10:31:10Z,7f692572-3e40-414b-af8b-d0824d5dbf5d,https://www.bensbites.co/p/microsoft-1-google-0-100bn-mistake

These are key features in LangChain that support prompt engineering for LLMs like OpenAI's GPT 3, Cohere, and Hugging Face's OS alternatives.

LangChain is a popular framework that allows users to quickly build apps and pipelines around Large Language Models. It integrates directly with OpenAI's GPT-3 and GPT-3.5 models and Hugging Face's open-source alternatives like Google's flan-t5 models.

It can be used for chatbots, Generative Question-Anwering (GQA), summarization, and much more.

The core idea of the library is that we can ""chain"" together different components to create more advanced use cases around LLMs. Chains may consist of multiple components from several modules. We'll explore all of this in these videos.

Disclaimer: this video assumes that you are familiar with the basics of deep learning, and that you've used HuggingFace Transformers at least once. If that's not the case, I highly recommend this course: http://cs231n.stanford.edu/ which will teach you the basics of deep learning. To learn HuggingFace, I recommend our free course: https://huggingface.co/course.

The video goes in detail explaining the difference between input_ids, decoder_input_ids and labels:
- the input_ids are the inputs to the encoder
- the decoder_input_ids are the inputs to the decoder
- the labels are the targets for the decoder.

What is ChatGPT?
ChatGPT is the latest language model from OpenAI and represents a significant improvement over its predecessor GPT-3. Similarly to many Large Language Models, ChatGPT is capable of generating text in a wide range of styles and for different purposes, but with remarkably greater precision, detail, and coherence. It represents the next generation in OpenAI's line of Large Language Models, and it is designed with a strong focus on interactive conversations.

How was ChatGPT trained?
The creators have used a combination of both Supervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning to fine-tune ChatGPT, but it is the Reinforcement Learning component specifically that makes ChatGPT unique. The creators use a particular technique called Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which uses human feedback in the training loop to minimize harmful, untruthful, and/or biased outputs.

What is the difference GPT-3 vs. ChatGPT?
Large Language Models, such as GPT-3, are trained on vast amounts of text data from the internet and are capable of generating human-like text, but they may not always produce output that is consistent with human expectations or desirable values.

The alignment problem in Large Language Models typically manifests as:
- Lack of helpfulness: not following the user's explicit instructions.
- Hallucinations: model making up unexisting or wrong facts.
- Lack of interpretability: it is difficult for humans to understand how the model arrived at a particular decision or prediction.
- Generating biased or toxic output: a language model that is trained on biased/toxic data may reproduce that in its output, even if it was not explicitly instructed to do so. 

What is Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback?
The method overall consists of three distinct steps:
- Supervised fine-tuning step: a pre-trained language model is fine-tuned on a relatively small amount of demonstration data curated by labelers, to learn a supervised policy (the SFT model) that generates outputs from a selected list of prompts. This represents the baseline model.
- “Mimic human preferences” step: labelers are asked to vote on a relatively large number of the SFT model outputs, this way creating a new dataset consisting of comparison data. A new model is trained on this dataset. This is referred to as the reward model (RM).
- Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) step: the reward model is used to further fine-tune and improve the SFT model. The outcome of this step is the so-called policy model.

ChatGPT performed at or near the passing threshold for all three exams without any specialized training or reinforcement. Additionally, ChatGPT demonstrated a high level of concordance and insight in its explanations. These results suggest that large language models may have the potential to assist with medical education, and potentially, clinical decision-making.  ### Competing Interest Statement  The authors have declared no competing interest.  ### Funding Statement  This study did not receive any external funding  ### Author Declarations  I confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.

link,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrAChpbwygE,"Generative AI and Long-Term Memory for LLMs (OpenAI, Cohere, OS, Pinecone)",YouTube,"Generative AI is what many expect to be the next big technology boom, and being what it is — AI — could have far-reaching implications far beyond what we'd expect.

One of the most thought-provoking use cases of generative AI belongs to Generative Question-Answering (GQA). 

Now, the most straightforward GQA system requires nothing more than a user text query and a large language model (LLM).

We can test this out with OpenAI's GPT-3, Cohere, or open-source Hugging Face models.

However, sometimes LLMs need help. For this, we can use retrieval augmentation. When applied to LLMs can be thought of as a form of ""long-term memory"" for LLMs.

Part 2,https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&v=ebjkD1Om4uw,"StrictlyVC in conversation with Sam Altman, part two (OpenAI)",YouTube,"OpenAI cofounder and CEO Sam Altman sat down for a wide-ranging interview with us late last week, answering questions about some of his most ambitious personal investments, as well as about the future of OpenAI. 

This second clip is focused exclusively on artificial intelligence, including how much of what OpenAI is developing Altman thinks should be regulated, whether he's worried about the commodification of AI, his thoughts about Alphabet's reluctance to release its own powerful AI, and worst- and best-case scenarios as we move toward a future where AI is ever-more central to our lives.

There was much to discuss (and he was generous to stay and talk about it).

You can find the first part our sit-down -- focused in part on Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion company that has become Altman's second-biggest project -- here: https://youtu.be/57OU18cogJI",Connie Loizos,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebjkD1Om4uw,2023-01-18T04:42:11.000Z,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwDUoP2N8DNfz6SZIKLomlg,"OpenAI's tell-all interview, Robots doing flips, and AI in the NHS",2023-01-19T10:27:42Z,d4e31756-c2c4-48b3-9ada-1e5f11d4ef67,https://www.bensbites.co/p/openais-tellall-interview-robots-flips-ai-nhs
Part 1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57OU18cogJI&t=1s,"StrictlyVC in conversation with Sam Altman, part one",YouTube,"At our StrictlyVC event a few nights ago, Altman was generous with his time, spending an hour with those gathered to talk about the latest at OpenAI (the hottest startup in the world at the moment), as well as answering questions about how his other investments fit into larger themes that he expects to play out -- and in the not-distant future. 

This is part one of that interview, focused on Altman's investments, including in Helion Energy, a nuclear fusion company that Altman described at the event as ""the other thing beside OpenAI that I spend a lot of time on."" We also talked Twitter, supersonic jets, making babies out of skin cells, and why he's ""not super interested"" in crypto.

We talk about connections to ChatGPT, which has taken the world by storm. We watch GitHub Copilot, itself a GPT, help us write a GPT (meta :D!) . I recommend people watch the earlier makemore videos to get comfortable with the autoregressive language modeling framework and basics of tensors and PyTorch nn, which we take for granted in this video.

- The GPU I'm training the model on is from Lambda GPU Cloud, I think the best and easiest way to spin up an on-demand GPU instance in the cloud that you can ssh to: https://lambdalabs.com . If you prefer to work in notebooks, I think the easiest path today is Google Colab.

Suggested exercises:
- EX1: The n-dimensional tensor mastery challenge: Combine the `Head` and `MultiHeadAttention` into one class that processes all the heads in parallel, treating the heads as another batch dimension (answer is in nanoGPT).
- EX2: Train the GPT on your own dataset of choice! What other data could be fun to blabber on about? (A fun advanced suggestion if you like: train a GPT to do addition of two numbers, i.e. a+b=c. You may find it helpful to predict the digits of c in reverse order, as the typical addition algorithm (that you're hoping it learns) would proceed right to left too. You may want to modify the data loader to simply serve random problems and skip the generation of train.bin, val.bin. You may want to mask out the loss at the input positions of a+b that just specify the problem using y=-1 in the targets (see CrossEntropyLoss ignore_index). Does your Transformer learn to add? Once you have this, swole doge project: build a calculator clone in GPT, for all of +-*/. Not an easy problem. You may need Chain of Thought traces.)
- EX3: Find a dataset that is very large, so large that you can't see a gap between train and val loss. Pretrain the transformer on this data, then initialize with that model and finetune it on tiny shakespeare with a smaller number of steps and lower learning rate. Can you obtain a lower validation loss by the use of pretraining?
- EX4: Read some transformer papers and implement one additional feature or change that people seem to use. Does it improve the performance of your GPT?

link,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.01.08.523187v1,Unlocking de novo antibody design with generative artificial intelligence,bioRxiv,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to greatly increase the speed, quality and controllability of antibody design. Traditional de novo antibody discovery requires time and resource intensive screening of large immune or synthetic libraries. These methods also offer little control over the output sequences, which can result in lead candidates with sub-optimal binding and poor developability attributes. Several groups have introduced models for generative antibody design with promising in silico evidence [[1][1]–[10][2]], however, no such method has demonstrated de novo antibody design with experimental validation. Here we use generative deep learning models to de novo design antibodies against three distinct targets, in a zero-shot fashion, where all designs are the result of a single round of model generations with no follow-up optimization. In particular, we screen over 400,000 antibody variants designed for binding to human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) using our high-throughput wet lab capabilities. From these screens, we further characterize 421 binders using surface plasmon resonance (SPR), finding three that bind tighter than the therapeutic antibody trastuzumab. The binders are highly diverse, have low sequence identity to known antibodies, and adopt variable structural conformations. Additionally, these binders score highly on our previously introduced Naturalness metric [[11][3]], indicating they are likely to possess desirable developability profiles and low immunogenicity. We open source[1][4] the HER2 binders and report the measured binding affinities. These results unlock a path to accelerated drug creation for novel therapeutic targets using generative AI combined with high-throughput experimentation.  ### Competing Interest Statement  The authors are current or former employees, contractors, interns, or executives of Absci Corporation and may hold shares in Absci Corporation.

Cohere is an AI company that allows us to use state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) in NLP. The Cohere Embed endpoint we use in this video gives us access to models similar to other popular LLMs like OpenAI's GPT 3, particularly their recent offerings via OpenAI Embeddings like the text-embedding-ada-002 model.

Pinecone is a vector database company allowing us to use state-of-the-art vector search through millions or even billions of data points.

Both services together are a powerful and common combination for building semantic search, question-answering, advanced sentiment analysis, and other applications that rely on NLP and search over a large corpus of text data.

At Playground AI, we combine AI research and product design to invent new kinds of creative tools.

Over the next 10 years we plan is create a powerful AI render pipeline that allows us to edit, create, and understand pixels to accomplish challenging tasks ranging from instructing an AI to make subtle changes to images, creating entire 3D environments, and understanding context of a scene in a video. We plan to start by accomplishing difficult tasks with images first.

We will learn how to use the OpenAI Embedding API to generate language embeddings, and then index those embeddings in the Pinecone vector database for fast and scalable vector search.

This is a powerful and common combination for building semantic search, question-answering, threat-detection, and other applications that rely on NLP and search over a large corpus of text data.

Everything will be implemented with OpenAI's new GPT 3.5 class embedding model called text-embedding-ada-002; their latest embedding model that is 10x cheaper than earlier embedding models, more performant, and capable of indexing ~10 pages into a single vector embedding.

The Harmonai team has been working hard on diffusion models for music generation. We're happy to bring you this stream to share the progress of our experiments!

We definitely appreciate any feedback you have on the music. These models aren't fully trained and are being worked on as we speak. We will keep sharing fresh new output. Keep tuning in if you want to hear our progress over the weeks and months. 

Disclaimer: The music is shared for research / educational / fair use purposes only. Any overfitting or similarity to real music is accidental (we're trying to avoid it).

Its ability to do different kinds of writing means it’s useful for many different kinds of businesses. Its capacity to respond to notes and revise its own work means there’s significant potential for hybrid human/AI work. Finally, we don’t yet know the limits of these models.

link,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LB4MVdpajsU,Open AI's ChatGPT based Chatbot using Python and Gradio | ChatGPT with Python,YouTube,"ChatGPT is a prototype artificial intelligence chatbot developed by OpenAI which specializes in dialogue. In this video, I'll show you how you can create a chatbot interface using OpenAI's API and Gradio. This is a mini-version of ChatGPT. The chatbot is a large language model fine-tuned with both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. It is based on OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model, an improved version of GPT-3. ChatGPT was launched in November 2022 and has garnered attention for its detailed responses and articulate answers, although its factual accuracy has been criticized.

Link to the repository : https://github.com/bhattbhavesh91/chatgpt-chatbot/blob/main/chatgpt-chatbot-notebook.ipynb

ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) was fine-tuned on top of GPT-3.5 using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning. Both approaches used human trainers to improve the model's performance. In the case of supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in which the trainers played both sides: the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement step, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation. These rankings were used to create 'reward models' that the model was further fine-tuned on using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms present a cost-effective benefit to trust region policy optimization algorithms; they negate many of the computationally expensive operations with faster performance.The models were trained in collaboration with Microsoft on their Azure supercomputing infrastructure. In comparison to its predecessor, InstructGPT, ChatGPT attempts to reduce harmful and deceitful responses; Unlike most chatbots, ChatGPT is stateful, remembering previous prompts given to it in the same conversation, which some journalists have suggested will allow for ChatGPT to be used as a personalized therapist. To prevent offensive outputs from being presented to and produced from ChatGPT, queries are filtered through a moderation API, and potentially racist or sexist prompts are dismissed. ChatGPT suffers from multiple limitations. The reward model of ChatGPT, designed around human oversight, can be over-optimized and thus hinder performance, otherwise known as Goodhart's law. Furthermore, ChatGPT has limited knowledge of events that occurred after 2021 and is unable to provide information on some celebrities. In training, reviewers preferred longer answers, irrespective of actual comprehension or factual content. Training data may also suffer from algorithmic bias; prompts including vague descriptors of people, such as a CEO, could generate a response that assumes such a person, for instance, is a white male.

Hey everyone, welcome to this quick tutorial on how to create an AI-powered content library using no-code tools like Airtable, OpenAI, Zapier, and WebFlow. In this tutorial, I'll show you two ways to do this - a semi-manual way and a fully automated way.

First, I'll give you a brief overview of my Airtable setup. This is the table that we'll push towards WebFlow, where you can see the fields that are relevant for this tutorial - role details and resume keywords. I'll show you how to use Airtable scripting to generate these keywords using OpenAI's API.

Next, I'll show you how to use Zapier to push the data from Airtable to WebFlow and format the text properly for markdown. Once this is done, a new item will be created in the WebFlow CMS and added to a collection on the website. You can either have it directly published or staged for later publication.

Finally, I'll show you what's possible with GPT-3 to create content for your website. I'll use the role details and resume keywords fields to generate a description for a role, such as a psychotherapist, as well as relevant resume keywords and boilerplate text.

I hope you find this tutorial helpful, and don't forget to check out the link in the description for the scripts and more detailed instructions on how to set this up. Thanks for watching!

We only require a short video clip of the person to create the avatar and assume no knowledge about the lighting environment. We present a novel framework to model humans while disentangling their geometry, texture, and also lighting environment from monocular RGB videos. To simplify this otherwise ill-posed task we first estimate the coarse geometry and texture of the person via SMPL+D model fitting and then learn an articulated neural representation for photorealistic image generation. RANA first generates the normal and albedo maps of the person in any given target body pose and then uses spherical harmonics lighting to generate the shaded image in the target lighting environment. We also propose to pretrain RANA using synthetic images and demonstrate that it leads to better disentanglement between geometry and texture while also improving robustness to novel body poses. Finally, we also present a new photorealistic synthetic dataset, Relighting Humans, to quantitatively evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.",,,,https://nvlabs.github.io/RANA/,,,Ben's Bites Hackathon - win up to $15k,2022-12-07T12:55:35Z,7738fd3f-1d75-4860-9241-32f091c8c64c,https://www.bensbites.co/p/bens-bites-hackathon-win-15k

Recent advances in neural rendering based reconstruction have achieved compelling results. 		However, these methods are limited to objects with closed surfaces since they adopt Signed Distance Function (SDF) 		as surface representation which requires the target shape to be divided into inside and outside. 		In this paper, we propose to represent surfaces as the Unsigned Distance Function (UDF) and develop 		a new volume rendering scheme to learn the neural UDF representation.     Specifically, a new density function that correlates the property of UDF with the volume rendering scheme     is introduced for robust optimization of the UDF fields.     Experiments on the DTU and DeepFashion3D datasets show that our method not only enables high-quality     reconstruction of non-closed shapes with complex typologies, but also achieves comparable performance     to the SDF based methods on the reconstruction of closed surfaces.",,,,https://www.xxlong.site/NeuralUDF/,,https://www.xxlong.site/,Ben's Bites Hackathon - win up to $15k,2022-12-07T12:55:35Z,7738fd3f-1d75-4860-9241-32f091c8c64c,https://www.bensbites.co/p/bens-bites-hackathon-win-15k

However, existing motion diffusion models largely disregard the laws of physics in the diffusion process and often generate physically-implausible motions with pronounced artifacts such as floating, foot sliding, and ground penetration. This seriously impacts the quality of generated motions and limits their real-world application. To address this issue, we present a novel physics-guided motion diffusion model (PhysDiff), which incorporates physical constraints into the diffusion process. Specifically, we propose a physics-based motion projection module that uses motion imitation in a physics simulator to project the denoised motion of a diffusion step to a physically-plausible motion. The projected motion is further used in the next diffusion step to guide the denoising diffusion process. Intuitively, the use of physics in our model iteratively pulls the motion toward a physically-plausible space. Experiments on large-scale human motion datasets show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art motion quality and improves physical plausibility drastically (>78% for all datasets).",,,,https://www.ye-yuan.com/physdiff,,,Text-to-product is here,2022-12-06T12:47:17Z,b275cf3e-8f37-4f26-a075-b3800ec77cd1,https://www.bensbites.co/p/texttoproduct

The researchers, Warren S. McCulloch and Walter Pitts, were trying to understand how the brain could produce such complex patterns by using basic, connected cells. Their work was foundational in understanding neurons, and l introduced the concept of the neural network which has since become a key concept in artificial intelligence. This was the oldest paper that Anton and Packy have discussed, and its naturally age led to a lengthy conversation on the history of artificial intelligence. That history -- like the history of many technological fields -- is spotted with long winters, golden ages, broken timeline promises, and sudden developments. Today, it seems, we may be in the middle of a golden age for artificial intelligence.   LINKS:

link,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIGlAsN1nEs,Advanced Sentiment Analysis with NLP Transformers + Vector Search,YouTube,"Sentiment analysis, often known as opinion mining, is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) to determine the emotional undertone of a text. Organizations use this to identify and group opinions about their product, service, and ideas.

In this video, we will learn how to apply sentiment analysis to huge datasets that can be turned into meaningful query databases rich with insights. We will apply this technique to the hotel industry and understand customer perception and potential improvement areas. To do this, we will:

1. Generate Sentiment labels and scores based on customer reviews.
2. Store them in a Pinecone index as metadata (alongside respective text vectors).
3. Query Pinecone index on selected areas and understand customer opinions.

🌲 Pinecone doc page:

The hedge fund manager turned entrepreneur is the founder of Stability AI, the company behind Stable Diffusion, an image-generating algorithm that creates new, never-before-seen pictures. 

It’s the most advanced technology in AI, and Emad is bringing it to the masses. In this mind-blowing conversation between two friends, Emad shows Raoul how quickly AI is progressing, what that progress means for our future, and why he chose to make Stable Diffusion an open source. 

This type of technology should be available to everyone in the world, Emad believes, not just corporate tech giants. His vision is AI of, by, and for the people – and with that comes great opportunity. Recorded on Wednesday, October 12, 2022.

(V2 Nov 2022: Updated images for more precise description of forward diffusion. A few more images in this version)  AI image generation is the most recent AI capability blowing people’s minds (mine included). The ability to create striking visuals from text descriptions has a magical quality to it and points clearly to a shift in how humans create art. The release of Stable Diffusion is a clear milestone in this development because it made a high-performance model available to the masses (performance in terms of image quality, as well as speed and relatively low resource/memory requirements).  After experimenting with AI image generation, you may start to wonder how it works.  This is a gentle introduction to how Stable Diffusion works.            Stable Diffusion is versatile in that it can be used in a number of different ways. Let’s focus at first on image generation from text only (text2img). The image above shows an example text input and the resulting generated image (The actual complete prompt is here). Aside from text to image, another main way of using it is by making it alter images (so inputs are text + image).",Jay Alammar,,,https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-stable-diffusion/,,,The first AI to laugh and Lex Fridman interviews Richard Feynman,2022-11-25T14:52:01Z,289d8ff3-e0eb-467c-beda-968199ea0993,https://www.bensbites.co/p/first-ai-laugh-lex-fridman-interviews-richard-feynman

Its implementation, however, lacks the code and data required to train new models. These are necessary to (i) tackle new tasks, like protein-ligand complex structure prediction, (ii) investigate the process by which the model learns, which remains poorly understood, and (iii) assess the model’s generalization capacity to unseen regions of fold space. Here we report OpenFold, a fast, memory-efficient, and trainable implementation of AlphaFold2, and OpenProteinSet, the largest public database of protein multiple sequence alignments. We use OpenProteinSet to train OpenFold from scratch, fully matching the accuracy of AlphaFold2. Having established parity, we assess OpenFold’s capacity to generalize across fold space by retraining it using carefully designed datasets. We find that OpenFold is remarkably robust at generalizing despite extreme reductions in training set size and diversity, including near-complete elisions of classes of secondary structure elements. By analyzing intermediate structures produced by OpenFold during training, we also gain surprising insights into the manner in which the model learns to fold proteins, discovering that spatial dimensions are learned sequentially. Taken together, our studies demonstrate the power and utility of OpenFold, which we believe will prove to be a crucial new resource for the protein modeling community.  ### Competing Interest Statement  M.A. is a member of the Scientific Advisory Boards of Cyrus Biotechnology, Deep Forest Sciences, Nabla Bio, Oracle Therapeutics, and FL2021-002, a Foresite Labs company.

See for more information: https://cats.for.ai/

In this second invited talk, Taco will survey the literature on category theory and causality and discuss his paper ""Towards a Grounded Theory of Causation for Embodied AI""  (https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13973)

Abstract:
Causal models are used in many areas of science to describe data generating processes and reason about the effect of changes to these processes (interventions). Causal models are typically highly abstracted representations of the underlying process, consisting of only a few carefully selected variables, and the causal mechanisms between them. This simplifies causal reasoning, but the relation between the model and the underlying system is never described in mathematical terms, and this has led to considerable philosophical confusions. Furthermore, it has made it hard to understand how causal modeling relates to other fields such as physics (where systems are described by dynamical laws without reference to causes), dynamical systems, and agent-centric frameworks such as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). In this talk we study this idea of abstraction from a categorical perspective, focussing on two questions in particular:
1. What is an appropriate notion of morphism between causal models? When can we say that one model is an abstraction of another? How can we set up a convenient category of causal models?
2. What does it mean for a causal model to be an abstraction of an underlying dynamical system or Markov decision process?
To answer the first question we will mainly survey the existing literature, while for the second we will present a new approach to grounding causal models in dynamical systems and MDPs via natural transformations, and giving for the first time a mathematical definition of ""causal mechanism"" as a functional relationship between outcome variables that is invariant to interventions (modelled as transformations of the state space).",Pim de Haan,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mZhcXhbciE,2022-11-22T06:27:24.000Z,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCss-kov2vQzYGDtGTcRw_PA,AI can guess 3D objects and how it moves,2022-11-23T12:57:37Z,36509a11-b2ed-4655-ba28-872897964125,https://www.bensbites.co/p/ai-can-guess-3d-objects-moves

ABOUT JOHN COOGAN:
I am the co-founder of http://soylent.com and http://lucy.co, both of which were funded by Y Combinator (Summer 2012 and Winter 2018).

I've been an entrepreneur for the last decade across multiple companies. I've done a lot of work in Silicon Valley, so that's mostly what I talk about. I've raised over 10 rounds of venture capital totaling over $100m in funding.

I work mostly in tech-enabled consumer packaged goods, meaning I use software to make the best products possible and then deliver them to the widest possible audience. I'm a big fan of machine learning, python programming, and motion graphics.

Googles wildfire simulation project,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEbbJHFwkUo,Simulating wildfires before they happen,YouTube,"Among the top 20 largest wildfires in California since the 1930s, more than 50% happened in the last 4.5 years. Expanding throughout the world, wildfire study has become evermore important in recent years - especially to understand the wildfire propagation process. 

In this episode of Meet A Google Researcher, @drewcalcagno sits down with Vivian Yang and John Anderson - Google Researchers who are interested in helping mitigate the effects of these wildfires by predicting fire behavior using AI & simulations. In this interview, we ask them about the importance of their work, challenges when creating these simulations, the benefits of these simulations, and more.

Naveen had an amazing journey full of learnings.

Naveen is the CEO and founder of Mosaic ML. The MosaicML Cloud makes it easy to train models of any size on any number of GPUs, helping teams achieve more accurate results faster and seamlessly scale workloads with distributed training methods. Naveen previously built the first AI-chip company Nervana Systems, which was acquired by Intel in 2016. He then joined Intel and started and ran Intel’s AI division.

11:16 I came with a focus, I didn’t meander. - on completing a Ph.D. ahead of time while having one of the most amazing times of his life.

16:41 We started seeing hints that this was something much bigger than just a new toy. - on Neural Networks.

18:27 Entrepreneurs and founders are zealots. -  on the difference between the founders and professional managers.

21:16 He made this company an AI company by his sheer will… - on Jenson. 

25:27 I was like, man… that’s having your back - on venture investors.

26:13 It hurt, it felt like I got dumped by my girlfriend… as a young engineer, when this stuff happens to you, it leaves a mark - on living through the dot-com bubble.

29:29 We came in and it was like, we’re on pause. - on building at Intel.

34:49 Oh shoot, they’re going to kill us - on reaction to Nervana’s acquisition by Intel. 

37:10 I think they tried to reach too far… and couldn’t hit it.

43:26 The H100 - it uses 2x the power, has 2x the performance and it costs 2x the price. We’re not seeing More’s Law. - Why focus on efficiency at Mosaic?

58:18 - You get something that performs way better - on training a model on PubMed.

1:03:39 - Do I want to be in the foxhole with this person? - on partnering with a co-founder.

1:05:26 - I’m not doing anything, just thinking about this problem… - on getting a term sheet from LUX. 

1:10:33 - You have to be irrational! - on building a team

1:18:52 - Trying your best to not have to fire someone should be what you really looking for… - on hiring execs.

1:25:00 - There will be a thing, where you generate stuff for various industries… and it’s completely untouched! - on opportunities in AI today.

1:35:12 - Building synthetic intelligences capable of processing vast amounts of data is how we’re going to make future scientific breakthroughs. - on the future of AI.

Podcast version,https://anchor.fm/mario-gabriele/episodes/What-to-Watch-in-AI-e1qio2m/a-a8rfi17,What to Watch in AI by The Generalist,Spotify for Podcasters,"Reid Hoffman, Saam Motamedi, Sarah Guo, Lan Xuezhao, Matt Turck, Leigh Marie Braswell, Nathan Benaich, Rob Toews, Cat Wu, and Michael Dempsey highlight the AI trends to keep an eye on. Brought to you by Sardine Scams only work if people believe they’re real. Scams hide in plain sight. The email outlining an investment opportunity or the phone call promising paid work may seem like good fortune. But more likely than not, they’re attempts to defraud you. The sophistication of these scams means that anyone is at risk. Last year, fraud losses increased 70%, suggesting that fraud is outstripping our technological defenses. It’s a problem that is constantly evolving. While people like me and you are at risk, so are companies. Businesses lose billions every year in scams, sometimes without realizing it since they’re often defrauded by “verified” customers. Sardine protects businesses from such threats. Leveraging sophisticated machine learning, Sardine stops the scammers from winning. You can think of them as the world’s best fraud team that you hire as an API. Compliance, onboarding, transaction monitoring, and fraud detection are all handled through Sardine’s simple API and SDK. The impact is major. Sardine helps businesses like FTX, Brex, Metamask, and Blockchain improve their conversion rates, raise order values, and lower fraud losses. Scale without the scams. Implement Sardine today.

AI and the Creator Economy with Karen X Cheng,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45kg85J3MPs,AI and the Creator Economy with Karen X Cheng,YouTube,"Generative AI tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion have taken the world by storm in recent months, wowing the masses with their uncanny ability to produce images via text prompts. 

In this interview, we’ll chat with Karen Cheng about how she’s leveraged these tools among others, with a focus on how this new paradigm is reshaping the creator landscape. You’ll get to hear the behind the scenes of many of her viral works, including a video of her becoming a lawnmower, her AI-generated Cosmo magazine cover, her DALL-E fashion show, her transforming iconic art into 3D museums to explore, and much, much more. By the end of this episode, listeners should have a better understanding of the new tools at their fingertips (literally!), how AI can indeed enhance the creative process, and the second-order effects of these innovations, like how creators are paid.

It's become increasingly obvious that we're in the Golden Age of AI, so we think it's important to demystify what's going on and how it all actually works.

Anton Troynikov is the founder of Chroma, former Meta Reality Labs Research Engineer and Roboticist.

Packy McCormick is the author of the popular tech and buinsess strategy newsletter, Not Boring.

Anton Teaches Packy AI is exactly what it sounds like -- each video, Anton breaks down AI to a level that Packy (your average above average smart person) can understand. 

In Episode 1, Anton and Packy discuss the groundbreaking ""Attention is All You Need"" research paper which kicked off the entire Transformer generative AI wave.

Watch the video here,https://youtu.be/1EkV5NPKXUc,How AI is helping to fight wildfires,YouTube,"Some of the major repercussions of climate change is an increased risk of wildfires and a prolonged wildfire season. The number of these natural disasters have been increasing and endangering people’s lives, safety, and health in profound ways. So the question remains, how can we prevent and mitigate the damage they cause?

In this episode of #MeetAGoogleResearcher, Drew Calcagno chats with Google Researchers Noam Loya and Omer Nevo about the creative AI models their teams have made to assist firefighters’ responses to wildfires. Moreover, we’ll dive deeper into this research, asking how these researchers work with fire departments, the influence of social impact on their research, and more!

released an AI Bill of Rights,https://www.governmentciomedia.com/white-houses-ai-bill-rights-codifies-ethical-use-privacy,"White House's 'AI Bill of Rights' Codifies Ethical Use, Privacy",gciomag,The collaborative document aims to keep AI ethical and equitable while standardizing best practices at the federal level.,,"Artificial intelligence is showing much promise for driving efficiencies across the federal government, but many leaders want to alleviate concerns regarding ethical use of AI and potential bias inherent in some algorithms and data sets fueling the technology. The White House's newly released AI Bill of Rights aims to codify some of these solutions across all of government — an effort underpinning presidential priorities around holding government accountable and improving trust.  “Automated technologies are driving remarkable innovations and shaping important decisions that impact people’s rights, opportunities, and access. The Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights is for everyone who interacts daily with these powerful technologies — and every person whose life has been altered by unaccountable algorithms,” White House Office of Science and Technology Policy Deputy Director Alondra Nelson told GovCIO Media & Research.    The AI Bill of Rights was created in consultation with major federal agencies, including considerable input and expertise drawn from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ National Artificial Intelligence Institute (NAII), as well as with feedback from the American public. This collaboration contributed to the core protections of the strategy, including safe and effective systems, data privacy, notice and explanation, and alternative options.    “OSTP has identified five principles that should guide the design, use and deployment of automated systems to protect the rights of the American public in the age of artificial intelligence,"" NAII Director Dr. Gil Alterovitz told GovCIO Media & Research right after an announcement during VA's annual BRAIN Summit. ""Developed through extensive consultation with the American public, these principles are a blueprint for building and using technologies in ways that are rooted in democratic values and protect civil rights.""  The AI Bill of Rights builds off the foundation created by the December 2020 Trustworthy AI Executive Order that outlined nine distinct principles to ensure agencies “design, develop, acquire and use AI in a manner that fosters public trust and confidence while protecting privacy.”   As Alterovitz explained, the AI Bill of Rights condenses these into a framework that seeks to reconcile technical advancement in ways that advance the core values of American civil society.   Alterovitz noted that “NAII [has] established four strategic goals for fiscal years 2022 through 2026” which he summarized as:   “Providing cutting-edge AI research, projects and pilots to enhance outcomes and experiences for Veterans and VA staff. Providing sought-after thought leadership and frameworks for the implementation of trustworthy AI. Building strategic partnerships across the private sector, the federal government and the research community to maximize AI's potential to benefit veterans, and continuing to develop the NAII organization and workforce to meet the growing AI needs of those serving veterans.”   As the largest integrated health care system in the country, VA's artificial intelligence research and in-house capacities lends to its pivotal role in advising on the AI Bill of Rights and may set precedence for future applications of the technology across the government.  “The practices laid out in the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights aren’t just aspirational; they are achievable and urgently necessary to build technologies and a society that works for all of us,” Nelson added.",,https://www.governmentciomedia.com/white-houses-ai-bill-rights-codifies-ethical-use-privacy,,,GPT-3 in Google Sheets,2022-11-01T12:22:28Z,ef7eb34f-a120-479f-9340-9d797789599b,https://www.bensbites.co/p/gpt3-google-sheets

I worked at Tesla starting in July of 2017 as an Operations Analyst out of the Bethlehem, PA distribution center facility and left as a Program Manager based out of Austin, TX as of September 2021. I spent most of my time in the distribution and supply chain organizations.

Before Tesla, I was a Director of Business Intelligence and Pricing at the largest Pet Food & Supply distributor in the US, Phillips Pet Food & Supplies based out of Easton, PA. My wife and I also owned a small business in Bethlehem, PA between 2016 and 2019.

My thoughts are my own and are not representative of everyone who currently works, or has worked at Tesla.

transform sensitive user data in a way that guarantees fairness,https://dpmd.ai/lassi,Latent Space Smoothing for Individually Fair Representations,,"Fair representation learning transforms user data into a representation  that ensures fairness and utility regardless of the downstream application.  However, learning individually fair representations, i.e., guaranteeing  that similar individuals are treated similarly, remains challenging in  high-dimensional settings such as computer vision. In this work, we  introduce LASSI, the first representation learning method for certifying  individual fairness of high-dimensional data. Our key insight is to  leverage recent advances in generative modeling to capture the set of  similar individuals in the generative latent space. This enables us to  learn individually fair representations that map similar individuals close  together by using adversarial training to minimize the distance between  their representations. Finally, we employ randomized smoothing to provably  map similar individuals close together, in turn ensuring that local  robustness verification of the downstream application results in end-to-end  fairness certification. Our experimental evaluation on challenging  real-world image data demonstrates that our method increases certified  individual fairness by up to 90% without significantly affecting task  utility.",,,,https://www.deepmind.com/publications/latent-space-smoothing-for-individually-fair-representations,,,Can you find the cork?,2022-10-26T12:11:31Z,1a95d5c9-4439-40a4-9053-b46937bf23f4,https://www.bensbites.co/p/can-find-cork

Nat Friedman,https://youtu.be/lnufceCxwG0,Nat Friedman (Former GitHub CEO): Building AI-Native Products & What’s Next For AI | TransformX 2022,YouTube,"AI researchers have given the world a revolutionary new platform in the form of large models trained on internet data. And the game has changed dramatically with the recent release of advanced open source models.

Some people think that the model is the product. It is not. It is an enabling technology that allows new products to be built. The breakthrough products will be AI-native, built on these models from day one, by entrepreneurs who understand both what the models can do, and what people actually want to use.

While many AI technologies are still in their infancy, several are starting to emerge as practical for real-world applications. Many new AI-native products have grown explosively, reaching millions of users and creating huge businesses practically overnight. This is just the beginning.

Nat Friedman was the CEO of GitHub from 2018 to 2022, led Microsoft’s $7.5 billion acquisition of GitHub, and founded two startups. Friedman is joined by Alexandr Wang, Founder and CEO of Scale, to explore this new AI-native future and what it will take to succeed.",Scale AI,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnufceCxwG0,2022-10-23T17:07:31.000Z,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAHS4cP-uIXdrpCsSfGq_OA,GPT-3 playground,2022-10-25T07:07:42Z,14916d2d-cc91-413c-bb2a-1e1297da6902,https://www.bensbites.co/p/gpt3-playground
Greg Brockman,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp3A5q9L_bg,"OpenAI's Greg Brockman: The Future of LLMs, Foundation & Generative Models (DALL·E 2 & GPT-3)",YouTube,"Greg Brockman, President and Co-Founder of @OpenAI, joins Alexandr Wang, CEO and Founder of Scale, to discuss the role of foundation models like GPT-3 and DALL·E 2 in research and in the enterprise. Foundation models make it possible to replace task-specific models with those that are generalized in nature and can be used for different tasks with minimal fine-tuning.

In January 2021, OpenAI introduced DALL·E, a text-to-image generation program. One year later, it introduced DALL·E 2, which generates more realistic, accurate, lower-latency images with four times greater resolution than its predecessor. At the same time, it released InstructGPT, a large language model (LLM) explicitly designed to follow instructions. InstructGPT makes it practical to leverage the OpenAI API to revise existing content, such as rewriting a paragraph of text or refactoring code.

Before creating OpenAI, Brockman was the CTO of Stripe, which he helped build from four to 250 employees. Watch this talk to learn how foundation models can help businesses benefit from applications that they can create more quickly than with past generations of AI tools.",Scale AI,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rp3A5q9L_bg,2022-10-23T18:32:05.000Z,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAHS4cP-uIXdrpCsSfGq_OA,GPT-3 playground,2022-10-25T07:07:42Z,14916d2d-cc91-413c-bb2a-1e1297da6902,https://www.bensbites.co/p/gpt3-playground

Stable Diffusion disrupted the deep learning scene when it was released in August, advancing the field of text-to-image models because of its ability to generate photo-realistic images given any text input. And unlike other models, Stable Diffusion makes its source code available, further advancing the democratization of AI. Stable Diffusion was created by Stability AI, in collaboration with EleutherAI and LAION.

chat about Programming Possibilities with AI,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYBcH3JjLxs,Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott on Programming Possibility with AI,YouTube,"Microsoft CTO Kevin Scott joins Greylock general partner Reid Hoffman for a discussion about the impact of AI on cognitive (or knowledge) work. Scott, whose company developed the programming assistant tool GitHub Copilot, advises people building machine learning systems (or entire companies) around AI to maintain a clear sense of responsibility and awareness of the potential negative impacts.

In addition to his experience in the conception, development, and adoption of new technology in enterprise organizations, Scott is known for his dedication to figuring out how AI can level the playing field for society. This is driven by his unique perspective from his upbringing in a rural community in Virginia. His experience from his personal background and career converge in his 2020 book “Reprogramming the American Dream: From Rural America to Silicon Valley, Making AI Work for Us All,” which posits that AI can (and should) be developed to promote economic growth for all industries and individuals.

In another video I've used #deforum and also had a look at #discodiffusion. This time I wanted to use Automatic1111. As a music producer and creator, I originally felt threatened by the technology but what I've come to realise is this. If you use it like a director/ producer you'll be able to make things beyond that of the average AI art fan.

I challenged myself to produce a track and video in under 12 hours and created this, using a combination of over a decades worth of creative insights and a new piece of AI tech (Stable Diffusion), I'm absolutely blown away by the results.

make the artistic process more accessible,https://youtu.be/R_f-v6prMqI,How Imagen & Parti make the artistic process more accessible,YouTube,"Text-to-image models are a novel machine learning technology that can generate high-quality, photorealistic images from a simple text prompt. Within Google Research, our scientists and engineers have been exploring text-to-image generation using a variety of AI techniques.

Imagen and Parti, Google’s text-to-image models, have the ability to generate photorealistic images but use different approaches. Imagen is a Diffusion model, which learns to convert a pattern of random dots to images. Parti’s approach takes advantage of existing research and infrastructure for large language models such as PaLM and is critical for handling long, complex text prompts to produce high-quality images. 

In this third episode of #MeetAGoogleResearcher, Drew Calcagno speaks with Google Research Scientists Mohammad Norouzi - who worked on Imagen - and Jason Baldridge - who worked on Parti. They’ll talk about their role in creating each of these models, how they’re making the art process more accessible to artists and non-artists alike, and the future of text-to-image generation.

Watch and see how these models are bridging quantitative and qualitative fields, while giving us insight to our own knowledge of the real world.
