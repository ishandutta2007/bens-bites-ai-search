Happy Monday and welcome to the 1,155 new folks joining since last week.

This is Ben's Bites, the daily AI newsletter that kicks off the week faster than a strong cup of coffee. And it is Monday, so coffee is necessary...

Let's get to it.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

I built a way to **upload data and you can ask it questions with AI**. So you could theoretically upload any data (my example is animal facts) to a google sheet, then use this automation to enter a question e.g. "What is the tallest mammal?" and AI using embeddings will search through the data and return the response. All built without any code. ([link](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1611422735049322499))

What would an **AI + search engine look like**? Well, wonder no more. Neeva have released NeevaAI.

It combines the power of AI with a search stack to give you fast, accurate, and up-to-date results. And, it provides sources where the information was pulled from. (Not made up sources btw).

Neeva AI - **Authentic, real-time AI search**. ([link](https://neeva.com/blog/introducing-neevaai))
