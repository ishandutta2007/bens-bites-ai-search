Hey everybody, and welcome to the 2,703 people joining from last week. A quiet one for me, amidst tears from watching Wales lose, again.

This is Ben's Bites - the AI newsletter that will tickle your circuits with its daily dose of AI puns and information.

Let's get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

**[PhotoAI.io transforms your photos into a benchmark style](https://photoai.io/)**

I‚Äôve always fancied myself to be a hit in the modelling industry (üòÇ ofc not), and now I can basically turn myself into one with [**PhotoAI.io**](https://photoai.io/). This is [**the guy**](https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1624118401043161089?s=20\&t=C6jxGzyRUiG_ygZHDZi7mQ) (Pieter Levels) that brought us those insanely popular personalised avatars last year. Now he's propelled that into photorealism - select a model photo and get your photos fully transformed into that style. Adjust your clothes, your stance, your setting, and more. Although, errr, it‚Äôs kind of catfisher heaven right!?

**2/**

[**ChatGPT is a blurry JPEG of the web**](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web)

I‚Äôm a big fan of **taking a step back** and assessing reality when there‚Äôs a great deal of excitement frothing around something new (chatbot AI), and [**this article**](https://www.newyorker.com/tech/annals-of-technology/chatgpt-is-a-blurry-jpeg-of-the-web) satisfied that hunger in me! They compare **LLMs** to a blurry JPEG image - something that‚Äôs unable to perfectly replicate existing information and can be wrong, but roughly represents the important bits of information that it received. With lots of talk around search engines shifting to chatbot styles, it‚Äôs important to ask ourselves the question: Do we actually *want* what essentially amounts to a lossy compression (ChatGPT), rather than something returning lossless results (Google search)?

For some more healthy scepticism, check out [**this one**](https://www.jonstokes.com/p/what-if-the-future-of-agi-rhymes) arguing that perhaps perfectly mimicking humans is the wrong approach to reach AGI; and [**this one**](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/inside-the-heart-of-chatgpts-darkness) stating that whatever we do, dark thoughts and expressions will always be lurking within chatbot technology, and we‚Äôre merely able to suppress these.

**3/**

[**Microsoft to integrate ChatGPT into Word, Powerpoint, and Outlook**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/10/23593980/microsoft-bing-chatgpt-ai-teams-outlook-integration)

*I* *meeeaaan*, it‚Äôs kinda obvious that it‚Äôs gonna happen but still, it‚Äôs pretty fun to hear rumours this exciting hitting a platform as big as **The Verge**. They‚Äôre reporting that **Microsoft** has full intentions to **integrate ChatGPT** across all of its productivity services - **Word, Powerpoint, Outlook**, the lot. Imagine a world where word documents are continuously generating long-form suggestions, Powerpoint is able to design and generate unique visuals, and Outlook can respond to emails in your personal style. Wowzer.
