Let‚Äôs get to it.

[Elon Musk opines on AI and just about everything else under the sun](https://youtu.be/PDy7s1SDDn4?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=make-belief-rules-for-ai-regulation)

He‚Äôs definitely not everyone‚Äôs cup of tea, but I have to say I‚Äôve got a soft spot for him, and he‚Äôs up for talking about*everything*. This interview with the WSJ saw**Elon Musk**cover everything from Twitter (a lot of Twitter, of course) to the Chinese political situation, through that long-distant topic of Mars civilisation and the future of humanity.

But what about AI specifically? Well, he seems to think**AGI is on its way and out of control**, and there‚Äôs a risk that it either eliminates or constrains the growth of humanity. (Had to throw in that Tesla‚Äôs AI is the best in the world though‚Ä¶) But the best part of all: he turned up half an hour late and spoke for half an hour longer than scheduled.ü§£

[Google are preparing an AI Pact whilst the EU draws up the law](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/24/eu-google-ai-pact/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=make-belief-rules-for-ai-regulation)

Well I guess someone has to be the teacher‚Äôs pet at the front of the class with their hand up‚Ä¶ and who else than**Google**, right? Looks like they‚Äôre cosying up to the EU, helping them**put together an ‚ÄòAI Pact.‚Äô**This will essentially be a stop-gap**set of voluntary rules**whilst the lawmakers knock their heads together to rustle some regulations up.

According to an EU commissioner, ‚Äúthere is no time to lose to build a safe online environment around AI.‚Äù Can‚Äôt disagree! And given how long these things take to draw up, a stop-gap is probs totally necessary. One problem‚Ä¶ only Google has signed up.

[Sam Altman covers all things AI on his European tour](https://www.vccafe.com/2023/05/24/impressions-from-sam-altmans-talk-in-london/?amp=\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=make-belief-rules-for-ai-regulation)

We started with Elon and we‚Äôre finishing with**Altman**- who knew that he‚Äôs doing a European tour of talks!? Anyway, naturally this was a**true AI chat**. Interestingly, he sees**AI becoming less biased than people**- I guess it can be trained away from bias and then re-learn from itself when it floods the web with content.

He also reckons that**artists should be compensated**if they influence AI art (but doesn‚Äôt know how). He believes that the future of AGI will be billions of agents collaborating, just like humanity. Oh, and one more thing - OpenAI are working on a**multimodal input for ChatGPT**üëÄ
