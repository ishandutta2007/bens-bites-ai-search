Hello and welcome to the 4,558 new folks joining since last week. A quiet weekend for me, which meant I had time to tinker‚Ä¶

I created a quick program called ‚ÄòRaise‚Äô - a way for AI startups and investors to get connected. [Simplest landing page in the world here](https://raise.bensbites.co/).

- **Founders** - are you raising? If so, submit your startup to get in front of investors.

- **Investors** - fill in the form and get access to startups raising.

If there‚Äôs a mutual fit, we‚Äôll connect you. (I borrowed this setup from the Mercury Raise program)

Let‚Äôs get to it.

**1/**[Stability AI is reportedly raising again, at a $4B valuation.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-03/openai-rival-stable-diffusion-maker-seeks-to-raise-funds-at-4-billion-valuation)

Stability AI, the parent company of Stable Diffusion, raised its**last round in October**, i.e. less than 5 months ago. They raised $101M at a $1B valuation and now they‚Äôre reportedly talking with investors again. Bloomberg reports that this time the valuation in discussion is $4B dollars.

(non-paywalled version[here](https://archive.vn/t5nHa))

**2/**[Why AI Won't Cause Unemployment.](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/why-ai-wont-cause-unemployment)

Marc Andreessen has recently started a substack and in this post, he debunks the belief that AI will take away your job. According to Marc, in regulated industries, say healthcare or education,\*\*innovation is stagnant or sometimes even illegal.\*\*And the percentage of these industries in the GDP is increasing (because of higher prices).

He then released a[follow-up](https://pmarca.substack.com/p/followup-to-why-ai-wont-cause-unemployment)to this post: ‚ÄúAI is going to have a profound (and almost entirely positive) effect on our society. It just won‚Äôt show up in the economy the way many people expect.‚Äù

**3/**[They thought loved ones were calling for help. It was an AI scam.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/03/05/ai-voice-scam/)

Ruth Card and her husband were tricked by a phone scammer pretending to be their grandson who was in jail. The scammer used **artificially-generated voice technology to imitate their grandson's voice**. This scam is part of a rising trend of people, often elderly, being duped into sending money to those pretending to be their friends and family. Despite recent advancements in AI technology, there are few legal precedents to hold companies accountable for these scams, leaving victims with few leads to identify the perpetrator.

**4/ Ben‚Äôs Bites challenge**
