Hey folks, this is Ben's Bites your daily guilt-free fix of AI news. Or as it was described to me yesterday, a summary email for AI twitter.

When an ex-founder starts a daily newsletter, you have to understand that's a sign of great respect in their culture. üòÇ

Let's get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

Have you heard about Anthropic? Well, they're in a closed beta right now with **a new AI assistant called Claude**.

Don't feel bad, I haven't got access yet either üò°. It's supposed to be different than ChatGPT (does it get overwhelmed every 10 mins?!!). Claude knows more about its **creators** and **ethical** **principles**. And it can **process more text** too. They're using something called "Constitutional AI" to make sure it doesn't give harmful outputs. They even did a test where they compared Claude to ChatGPT, and Claude was more aware of its own limitations. Like, it knew it couldn't take the cube root of a 12-digit number (OMG same).

There are a bunch of examples comparing the outputs of ChatGPT and Claude which are worth a look. And it looks like it's **a serious contender to ChatGPT**.

Now this isn't your average 2-hour YouTube watch. This is a lecture from **Andrej** **Karpathy**. In it, he goes through how to \*\*build a Generatively Pretrained Transformer (GPT)\*\*following the pivotal paper "Attention is All You Need".

Let's**build GPT**: from scratch, in code, spelled out. A tutorial form Andrej Karpathy. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kCc8FmEb1nY))

Reid Hoffman has done a lot of things; angel in Facebook, co-founder Linkedin, Investor in OpenAI, and on and on I could go! But I wont. He sits down with host, Elad Gil, to chat about AI, Big Tech and Startups. Reid's also working on an AI startup of his own üëÄ .
