### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**The new Bing demo made more mistakes than Google‚Äôs Bard**](https://dkb.blog/p/bing-ai-cant-be-trusted)

Woooaah, wait a second. After last week‚Äôs fervour around **Google‚Äôs Bard** **demo** making a mistake, it turns out that **Bing‚Äôs chatbot demo** made *even more mistakes*. Only we were all too clouded by the excitement that none of us noticed! It said the cons of a hoover that has no cord include its short cord; that you can book a reservation at a restaurant that you can‚Äôt book a reservation at, and it completely hallucinated a bunch of numbers from a financial statement. Yes, this was all in the demo. Well, I guess Google has brought it back to a draw? **Google 1, Microsoft 1**.

But wait a third! It turns out Bard technically [**didn‚Äôt even make a mistake**](https://www.ft.com/content/16986b1e-b96a-4cb5-9450-b96fae622fdd)! Facepalm. **Google 2, Microsoft 1**‚Ä¶ Although in terms of hype levels, it kinda feels like Microsoft is still winning. And this is all probably exactly why Google and Meta fell behind Microsoft on this in the first place - they‚Äôre all too familiar with the potential impact of premature tech releases, and they may yet turn out to be right.

**2/**

[**AskFred by fireflies.ai is the best-looking AI assistant for meetings yet**](https://twitter.com/krishramineni/status/1625085660762873857)

I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm getting a bit exasperated by the deluge of tools doing the same things built on **ChatGPT**, but all the **AI-assistants-for-meetings** ones are really piquing my interest, including **AskFred from fireflies.ai**. ‚ÄúKnowledge originates, and is buried, in meetings‚Äù, and we spend a hell of a lot of time in them - probably too long. This tech unravels that buried knowledge by listening to meetings you‚Äôve been in. It can then draft follow-up emails, write specs, consolidate feedback, and complete actions. All with a slick little UI to match.

Bonus: you can [hook fireflies up to other apps using Zapier](https://zapier.com/apps/fireflies/integrations). Transcribe and summarise your meetings automatically? Yes, please.

**3/**

[**AI art opens up unfortunate avenues to abuse women‚Äôs rights**](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/02/13/ai-porn-deepfakes-women-consent/)

I usually like to keep these Picks light, but some things are too important to miss out. As The Washington Post reports here, 96% of all **online deep fakes are pornographic**- that means that there could be a hell of a lot of non-consensual porn circulating online, which is a nightmare for women. As they argue, the generative art AI revolution opens a whole new avenue by which women can be abused. As such, given the speed with which it is developing, it is **essential for regulators and lawmakers to update processes and rules**with equal speed, in order to **safeguard those that are most vulnerable** to misuse of this exciting, but potentially dangerous, technology.
