Hello and welcome to the 7,628 new folks joining from last week. That’s right, we’re growing around 1k subs a day 😳.

Milan is the city of style and something must’ve stuck with me because I spent the weekend watching Rugby and sprucing up the look of the email 💅.

Let’s get to it.

*p.s. if you joined us from Substack you’ve now been migrated here - I was copy/pasting the email every day to cater for Substack readers but there’s a huge number here vs there. You’ll still get the email, just in your inbox, not in Substack. Apologies if you hate that but had to be done!*

### 🤌 Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[OpenAI’s plan for integrating AI developments into society safely](https://openai.com/blog/planning-for-agi-and-beyond/)

When Sam Altman of**OpenAI**opines on the future of AGI we rightly listen and take heed. Especially when it comes hot in the footsteps of Eliezer Yudkowsky planting his core doomsday hypothesis right in front of us. On Friday, OpenAI’s blog saw an outline of their 3 main goals to tackle and direct**AGI integration**: 1) Empower humanity, 2) Ensure benefits and governance are accessible to all, and 3) Make sure we can navigate the massive risks.

For me, the most notable of their focuses is on**small, gradual increments**of model improvement and deployment. There is a clear emphasis on ensuring that people are ready to receive AGI by becoming**slowly acquainted**with the general technology. What does this mean? Not rushing into releases, and a possible push for regulation that requires**independent parties to check models**before training and deployment. They even go as far as suggesting possible**limits on training compute power**…

Take from this what you will, but it’s comforting to see such big players taking safety, alignment, and integration seriously without feeling the need to go full doomer.

**2/**

[Meta release LLaMA, beating benchmarks with more parameters](https://twitter.com/guillaumelample/status/1629151231800115202?s=46\&t=zOjbl0Nu_24jlD9efnk8Aw)

**Meta**have released**LLaMA**, an LLM comprising 4 foundation models with 7B to 65B parameters, claiming that it outperforms many benchmark models on various tasks, including GPT-3. And all this with\*\*<10% of parameters\*\*! There’s also a big emphasis on their openness with the model, claiming to lead the way on making models accessible. But not so fast…[Accusations](https://twitter.com/marktenenholtz/status/1629485367715065856)have been floating around that Meta has been somewhat deceptive here, and that actually the weights and tokeniser are not open-sourced at all. If true, they’re claiming openness on a model that has no API, no interface, and no discernible commercial use. I’ll let you guys be the judge on this one.

**3/**

[Voicemod are shaping up to be a competitor in the voice AI space](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/24/voicemod/)

I’m absolutely loving the wave of voice-generation AI going on right now - I’ve even started reading out-loud to myself each evening to build up enough voice recordings to AI myself up! The latest on this front is**Voicemod**, who are looking to combine their voice-to-voice tech with Voctro Labs’ sing-to-sing tech to reach an amped up hybrid of**speaking and singing tools**. With their most recent funding round hitting $14.5m, they’re shaping up to be one of the big competitors in this space.

With the podcasting and audiobook spaces gaining so much popularity in recent years, I think this sort of tech is going to shape up to be huge for revenue generation and time-saving. But don’t fret sound engineers: they’re of the welcoming view that human factors will always be necessary to get rhythm and tone right - to make it*real*.
