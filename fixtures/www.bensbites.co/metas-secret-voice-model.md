# Meta's secret voice model

### PLUS: Self-healing code, MIT vs AI, and GPT-4 with tools

Hey folks, today we have Meta, for the first time, scared of making their models public (it‚Äôs voice generation this time).

Then we have two instances of automatic tools taking up significant space: The case for self-healing code from Stackoverflow and why GPT-4 with tools is a big deal from Dan Shipper.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

**Next-Level Automation series with Zapier**

Hi y‚Äôall! It‚Äôs Dyan, an operations specialist at Zapier. I‚Äôm wrapping up the final segment of Zapier‚Äôs Next-Level Automation series, where we‚Äôve been spotlighting how AI can revolutionize your workflows.

Most businesses can attest to this simple truth: a seamless customer experience is critical to success. Yet finding that experiential sweet spot is no easy feat, and getting real-time customer feedback on product innovations means a lot of learnings with not a lot of time to consume them.

Enter: AI.

I was able to create an AI-powered Zapier workflow that distills customer interactions into accessible summaries so employees all across the company can implement those learnings into enhanced customer conversations and tangible product improvements ASAP. And this is just one of many business-critical use cases the folks at Zapier have developed to make AI actionable.[Come watch me](https://zapier.com/resources/webinar/zapathon-put-ai-to-work?utm_campaign=-gbl-evnt-ooc-ai_june2023_webinar-\&utm_medium=paid\&utm_source=bens_bites), plus many others, showcase our AI-powered use cases during our June 20th Zapathon.

[Meta announce a text-to-speech model that‚Äôs too good to make public](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/voicebox-generative-ai-model-speech/?ref=producthunt\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-secret-voice-model)

On Friday**Meta**announced something that‚Äôs so damn good that they‚Äôre[too scared to make it publicly available](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764565/meta-says-its-new-speech-generating-ai-model-is-too-dangerous-for-public-release?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-secret-voice-model)- the potential for misuse just isn‚Äôt worth the risk, and they‚Äôre not about that bad publicity. The tech is called**Voicebox**, and it‚Äôs a**text-to-speech generative AI model**that they say blows the competition outta the water. It‚Äôs able to create voice samples from scratch; take a sample and modify it; do so in 6 different languages, is 20x faster than prior models, and has**significantly better performance**.

And this is all without having to train it on a specific voice for a specific output‚Ä¶ You could do something like crop a dog barking out of a video of someone speaking, and regenerate it with pure speech. Nice! Can defo see where they‚Äôre coming from on the risk front tho‚Ä¶

[Stack Overflow think that self-healing code is the future of software development](https://stackoverflow.blog/2023/06/07/self-healing-code-is-the-future-of-software-development/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-secret-voice-model)

Every programmer‚Äôs favourite life-saver/goldmine,**Stack Overflow**, has a thing or two to say about the future of software development. And surprise surprise, it involves a whole lot of generative AI. The bottom line is that**current AI tech is very good at reviewing its own code**and generating improvements, leading to the idea of**self-healing code**.

Given that generative AI will result in a lot more code getting written a lot more quickly, AI itself will have to be used to review and improve code before it gets deployed - without it, there will be too much to review and**code-bases will end up with shoddy machine-generated code**that was never reviewed properly. Self-healing code is the solution, and the team at Stack Overflow reckon it‚Äôs the future.

[ChatGPT‚Äôs Function Calling is a big deal](https://every.to/chain-of-thought/gpt-4-can-use-tools-now-that-s-a-big-deal?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=meta-s-secret-voice-model)

Last week OpenAI released**Function Calling**as part of**ChatGPT**, which we touched on in[Wednesday‚Äôs issue](https://www.bensbites.co/p/final-beatles-song-ai-official)- but perhaps it deserves a bit more attention than it got. Dan Shipper at Every makes a pretty cool analogy in this post. It‚Äôs like a child‚Äôs ability to ask their parents to help them with a task that they know they can‚Äôt do on their own - except instead of parents, GPT is able to use the tools that its users hand straight to it. This makes GPT a whole load more powerful, bridging the gap between GPT tech and very powerful existing software that is hard to integrate with GPT. With this gap bridged, the ability of GPT to\*\*effectively write programs, execute processes,\*\*and be an agent is much greater.
