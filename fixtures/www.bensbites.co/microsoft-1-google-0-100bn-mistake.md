**1/**

**[Ben's Bites has a shiny new community ‚ú® it's free for you all.](https://discord.com/servers/ben-s-bites-1039224571376701510)**

I've enlisted some help to get Discord in better shape; onboarding, automation, channel management and even a playground to **play with AI** models like Midjourney, Hugging Face, ChatGPT (soon) and more (also soon). If you want to **hang out there**, share cool things you find or build and give feedback, everyone's welcome! There are already over 1,200 of you ü§Ø

[**Microsoft take the lead over Google in the Big AI Battle**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23590699/google-ai-search-features-bard-chatgpt-rival)

So after we‚Äôve spent the past week getting ourselves in a tizzy over the two unveilings in the **Big AI Battle**, what‚Äôs the verdict? Ohhhh, yes, it‚Äôs **Microsoft 1, Google 0**. The underdogs are in the lead. In the latter‚Äôs big event yesterday, they chose a demo question that [**flopped a wrong answer**](https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-ai-chatbot-bard-offers-inaccurate-information-company-ad-2023-02-08/), and it just all-around doesn‚Äôt *feel* quite as exciting. But this competition is great! I‚Äôm hoping Google pulls it back to 1-1 to keep the competition alive.

[**Google release immersive views on Maps**](https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/)

We‚Äôve all been in that situation on street view where you try to move down the street and suddenly jump to the other side of the country. Annoying, right? Well, Google‚Äôs new **immersive street maps** look like they‚Äôll solve all your map-related problems. The view is freakishly realistic, allows you to adjust to the weather, has building entrance locators, and, most importantly, gives you a **smooth ride down the street**. I can‚Äôt wait to give this a try. Check out the official [**blog post**](https://blog.google/products/maps/sustainable-immersive-maps-announcements/) for more cool mappy tools coming out.

\*\*Marketers,\*\*if someone paid you up to $100 for 7 minutes of your time would you do it? **(Sponsor)**

[Wynter](https://wynter.com/panelists/join-panel?utm_source=newsletters\&utm_medium=email\&utm_campaign=benbites) is a message-testing platform, and they need feedback from marketing executives and managers. They'll pay you between $15 - $100 per survey, $45-$100 if you're a **marketing leader**and at most the surveys take 7 minutes.
