Hey folks, today, we have Microsoft making another big-dog move with a super fast chip for AI models.

Adding to that, slowly, we are seeing more big names in the daily roundup. Companies are waking up to AI, be it Reddit, who wants a paycheck for its data used in training LLMs, or Chegg, whose ‚Äúdo my homework‚Äù audience was captured by ChatGPT.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[Reddit wants payback for all its scraped data](https://archive.is/UqhfS?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=microsoft-has-a-chip-on-their-shoulder)

We all know**Reddit**is an absolute treasure trove of some of the weirdest, funniest, most/least intellectual, and insightful sets of threads on the internet. And there‚Äôs something we‚Äôre all familiar with that‚Äôs been making abundant use of that‚Ä¶ Companies like**OpenAI**and**Google**have been making the most of Reddit‚Äôs free APIs to gobble up all this human-realistic content to train their**language models**. You can‚Äôt blame them! But Reddit‚Äôs founders seem to have had enough of the big dogs benefitting whilst the community doesn‚Äôt, and they‚Äôre about to demand a bit of dosh for them to continue doing so. Seems fair to me!

[Microsoft has been secretly designing a computer chip to power AIs](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-readies-ai-chip-as-machine-learning-costs-surge?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=microsoft-has-a-chip-on-their-shoulder)

If you‚Äôve ever wondered what goes on in big tech companies‚Äô secret lairs that they keep hidden from us, then look no further. Since 2019**Microsoft**have been secretly working on building a**computer chip**specifically designed to**super-power AI language models**. One chip to rule them all‚Ä¶ Named**Athena**, it‚Äôs available to a select number of Microsoft and OpenAI employees for testing, and is expected to be made available to the two firms next year. No one else though! Sorry!

ps: If you can‚Äôt access the paid link, there‚Äôs a nice little summary on[Ben‚Äôs Bites news](https://news.bensbites.co/posts/848-sources-microsoft-is-developing-an-ai-chip-internally-codenamed-athena-since-as-early-as-2019-some-microsoft-and-openai-staff-are-already-testing-the-chip?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=microsoft-has-a-chip-on-their-shoulder).

[The AI tool that can browse the web to complete a task is available as a ChatGPT plugin](https://twitter.com/divgarg9/status/1648394059483054081)

I remember choosing**MULTI¬∑ON** as a pick *aaaages* ago when language models were really starting to pick up the pace - before plugins, before agents, the lot. I thought it was so cool (and kinda creepy) how this AI-driven tool was just darting around the screen executing everything for them on the laptop. Well they‚Äôve just announced the creation of a **ChatGPT plugin**, which could actually be insanely powerful. If OpenAI approves the app (think we can call them apps yet?!) then this could become a **personal web browser**/task executor with serious strength! Hooked up to some of the AI Agents going around now, and the possibilities are pretty cool. Check out some demos on the link.
