### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Microsoft‚Äôs big event unveiled the new Bing and a browser copilot**](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2023/02/07/reinventing-search-with-a-new-ai-powered-microsoft-bing-and-edge-your-copilot-for-the-web/)

I was putting together some non-**Microsoft-vs-Google** pieces for today‚Äôs top pick, but then thought ‚Äúscrew it‚Äù, because this ain't getting any less exciting!

**Microsoft** held their private unveiling yesterday, and it *did not*disappoint. Yep, you can dabble in the [**AI-powered Bing engine**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23589587/microsoft-chatgpt-bing-ai-event-preview) from today, and use it as much as you like within a few weeks. But the most exciting thing for me? There‚Äôs gonna be a bloody [**browser copilot**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23587454/microsoft-bing-edge-chatgpt-ai)! (Only on Edge for now - some kind of browser you probably haven‚Äôt heard of üòÖ - but with plans to integrate into Chrome too.) It‚Äôll be able to do things like **summarise articles you‚Äôre reading**, answer questions and engage in a bit of back and forth. It‚Äôs Google‚Äôs turn today, and I have to say it - if they don‚Äôt announce a copilot I might just migrate to Microsoft. (all [Googlers were told to test Bard](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/02/06/google-ceo-tells-employees-it-needs-all-hands-on-deck-to-test-bard.html) before today's event)

The event video is [**here**](https://youtu.be/rOeRWRJ16yY), but if you want the live transcript, check it out [**here**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/7/23588249/microsoft-event-ai-live-blog-openai-chatgpt-bing-announcements-news). Be warned - it‚Äôs LONG.

**2/**

[**Baidu to release their own ChatGPT**](https://www.theregister.com/2023/02/07/baidu_erniebot_generative_ai_chatbot/)

Amongst all the excitement of Google and Microsoft, let‚Äôs not forget that the Chinese are also entering the AI chatbot scene in full force. **Baidu** - China‚Äôs Google equivalent - are releasing their version of the hottest new tech soon. And with a name like **Ernie**, it‚Äôs certainly more emotionally appealing than Bard. With **260 billion parameters,** its model is definitely bigger than GPT-3, and the [**2021 paper**](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.02137.pdf) claims to be ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù to all its rivals. I wonder what they‚Äôve managed to muster up over the last two years‚Ä¶

**3/**

[**Warmest.ai writes your emails in your own style**](https://twitter.com/garywupx/status/1623004850790494212?s=20\&t=Ju-Pjhzkvd6SF5MEbFJP8Q)

I had an excruciatingly painful call today with someone who insisted on sharing his screen whilst he drafted a very boring email incredibly slowly, so this tool is ringing very true to me right now! **Warmest.ai** uses your email history to learn how you respond to certain scenarios, and then **drafts emails for you in your own tone** - pretty nifty business.

You can build AI apps with no-code tools, **even if you're not a developer or haven't built a website before. **(Sponsor)****
