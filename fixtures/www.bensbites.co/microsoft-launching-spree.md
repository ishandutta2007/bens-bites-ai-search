Hey folks, today, we have MS Loop‚Äôs public preview, Github‚Äôs Copilot X, Mozilla starting an AI startup and Canva just added a bunch of new AI features.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

From our sponsors:

**Data chatbot for DTC brands - your own always-on, instant analyst.**

Use\*\*[Zenlytic's AI analyst](https://www.loom.com/share/d0db1ef81c034ab28e8b9761ab6ffafd)\*\*to ask what's driving your store's acquisition, conversion, and retention.

It's like having a data analyst who never sleeps. Who can instantly drill into your brand's data. Who never forgets to update your dashboards.

[Microsoft launches Loop, its Notion competitor, in public preview](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/22/microsoft-launches-loop-its-notion-competitor-in-public-preview/)

Microsoft has been trying out a**new office document**format for a while. They tried Fluid in 2020, and now Loop is available for public preview.

Loop is a project collaboration tool, separate from MS office but heavily linked to it. The catch, though, is that it is too\*\*similar to the UI of Notion,\*\*like way too similar. It has text blocks, pages, and workspaces. Check all the details and official demos[here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-loop).

Nonetheless, this is a move worth watching because it‚Äôs also competing with Google workspace to some extent. It will soon have a mobile app and if it‚Äôs not obvious, I‚Äôll say it: Loop has the**AI copilot**built into it.

[Introducing](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-mozilla-ai-investing-in-trustworthy-ai/)[Mozilla.ai](http://Mozilla.ai)[: Investing in trustworthy AI](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/introducing-mozilla-ai-investing-in-trustworthy-ai/)

Mozilla has a long-standing reputation for open source, and oh boy! they‚Äôre coming into the AI space\*\*. Mozilla AI**is a new community startup aimed at building a trustworthy, independent, and open-source AI ecosystem. They are committing**$30M\*\*for this effort with a talented founding team.

The way Mark Surman, the executive director of Mozilla Foundation, presents this in his blog post is quite interesting.*Good news: people care about****AI safety**\*\*and the less good news: big corporations don‚Äôt.*

[GitHub Copilot X: The AI-powered developer experience.](https://github.blog/2023-03-22-github-copilot-x-the-ai-powered-developer-experience/)

Copilot is one of the AI projects with substantial real-life adoption. It‚Äôs being used daily by developers, now writing**46% of the new code**coming from its users. But the primary feature is very limited to code auto-completion. GitHub has launched the next version of Copilot as**Copilot X**with a chat interface, PR support, and documentation QA.

If you‚Äôre following the tools section of the newsletter, developers have been making extensions and plugins to use AI with PRs, explaining repos etc. And I was listening to Nat Friedman (ex-CEO Github) on a separate interview talking about how they always tried to deliver on what developers needed. I guess it still does.

[Canva announces 10 new features at Canva Create](https://www.canva.com/newsroom/news/canva-create-brand-new-era-2023/)

Canva has been integrating AI into its visual suite, and it‚Äôs doing that rapidly.

This time they‚Äôve added ten more, yes TEN, NOT ONE OR THREE, new gifts (as they call them). There are a set of**Magic tools:**Magic design, Magic Presentation, Magic Eraser, and Magic Edit. Then there‚Äôs Draw on design, Beat Sync, and**Translate Designs.**

When the critics ask what‚Äôs the use of a random image generator for my business, it‚Äôs this. All of these AI capabilities becoming accessible in**widely adopted tools**like Canva. I can only imagine what the future holds.
