### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

The big news about town is: **[Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service is now generally available](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/general-availability-of-azure-openai-service-expands-access-to-large-advanced-ai-models-with-added-enterprise-benefits/)**. Developers can apply to access OpenAI's APIs and get enterprise features. It includes GPT3.5, Codex, DALLE2, and (soon) ChatGPT.

We‚Äôve been talking about how Microsoft + Open AI could be a threat to Google but watch out AWS. üëÄ

Satya Nadella claims this will ‚Äúhelp customers apply the world‚Äôs most advanced AI models to their own business imperatives.‚Äù Read more coverage from [<u>the Verge</u>](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/17/23558530/microsoft-azure-openai-chatgpt-service-launch).

Also, Open AI is making moves to increase AI adoption (and monetization). Last week Open AI put up a waitlist for paid access to the professional version of ChatGPT ([<u>link</u>](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCVqahRmA5OxQXbRlnSm531fTd8QBdUCwZag7mI9mrlOOIaw/viewform)), and now a **waitlist for ChatGPT API.** ([<u>link</u>](https://share.hsforms.com/1u4goaXwDRKC9-x9IvKno0A4sk30))

A trio of artists has filed a copyright lawsuit against Stable Diffusion and Midjourney ([link](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/16/23557098/generative-ai-art-copyright-legal-lawsuit-stable-diffusion-midjourney-deviantart)). The lawsuit proposes that any image produced by the models is a derivative work of any input image. Here‚Äôs an article on why the technical part of this claim doesn‚Äôt hold up. ([link](https://www.technollama.co.uk/artists-file-class-action-lawsuit-against-stability-ai-deviantart-and-midjourney))
