### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Microsoft releases Teams Premium using ChatGPT technology**](https://twitter.com/satyanadella/status/1620923372858380289)

**ChatGPT** has officially just swooped into the mainstream with Microsoft‚Äôs release of **Teams Premium**, with the AI technology being fully embedded! Now I‚Äôve just gotta convince my boss to fork out $7‚Ä¶ The tech comes with **automatically generated meeting notes**, recommended tasks, and personalised highlights, and looks [**pretty damn slick**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/02/01/microsoft-teams-premium-cut-costs-and-add-ai-powered-productivity/) to boot.

**2/**

[**ChatGPT releases $20/month subscription plan**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/openai-launches-chatgpt-plus-starting-at-20-per-month/)

Getting **‚Äúservers busy‚Äù messages** on ChatGPT *when you most want to use it*? Well, wave that frustration **goodbye for $20**‚Äîgotta make that $10bn back for investors. (But yeah, you‚Äôre right, the $42 pro fee that was doing the rounds indeed looks like some kind of weird error.)

Besides, this seems like a pretty **reasonable fee** for something that can help you with basically anything and only lies *sometimes*. Sam Altman has even hinted at upcoming, potentially cheaper, pro plans. It‚Äôs a shame that I‚Äôm based in England, and it‚Äôs only available in the US‚Ä¶

**3/**

[**AI chatbots can actually make us more skilled**](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/the-machines-of-mastery)

With chatter circulating that over-use of chatbots can dumb you down, this article actually makes a pretty compelling case for why using **AI can make you smarter.** (And no, sitting there like a potato all day letting ChatGPT do your dirty work is not how it works.)

They show a pretty awesome example of getting a chatbot to create scenarios to respond to, giving feedback on their responses, and then discussing how they can do better. Real, mistakes-driven practice‚Äîwhich is how anyone can get better at anything.

**4/**

[**Git commands in plain English**](https://git.roo.app/)

For some of you seasoned developers, it may come as a surprise that **a lot of people really struggle with using git** from the command line. Personally, I remember a time when it drove me absolutely crazy, and would have **loved nothing more than** [**this tool**](https://git.roo.app/). Type what you want to do into the command line in plain old English, and out comes the git command. Wicked!

**AutomationTown (Sponsor)**\
A new, binge-worthy podcast about automation & AI. What if you hired a cast of **professional voice actors,** a team of writers and scripted a fictional universe to teach automation? It‚Äôs a fresh spin on edutainment to trick your colleagues, friends, even your mom into being more productive. Listen to the **[season 3 trailer](https://share.transistor.fm/s/bab001af)** now.
