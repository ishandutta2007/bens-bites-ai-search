### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**None of us will experience superintelligence because it will have killed us first**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gA1sNLL6yg4\&t=8s)

After you battle your way through the 10 minute preamble about a pending existential crisis for the interviewer, you‚Äôll find yourselves in the hands of Eliezer Yudkowsky for *way* over an hour. And I guarantee you haven‚Äôt faced such pessimism. He talks about an **AI escape velocity** that produces **superintelligence**, and explains that superintelligence is a level of generality where it knows the **optimal move in every situation**. You cannot beat it. And as such it ‚Äúdoes not love you, it does not hate you, it is indifferent to you, and your atoms can be used for something more useful‚Äù. It will creep up on us, and **it will kill us** - and he‚Äôs even thought of the method it‚Äôll use to boot. Eeek!

Beyond the overriding backdrop of impending doom, this is actually a really good interview where Yudkowsky explains in detail many of the further-out aspects of the future of AI, and allows us to step inside the mind of one of (if not the) leading thinkers in **AI alignment**and safety.

**2/**

[**Are Hugging Face and AWS the next big chatbot partnership?**](https://huggingface.co/blog/aws-partnership)

First we had OpenAI and Microsoft; then came Anthropic and Google. Now it turns out that **Hugging Face and Amazon**have been dating on the sly and have decided to make it official! They plan to bring **generative AI**modelling to the people, making it faster and easier to train, fine-tune, and deploy models on the cloud in an open, accessible, and transparent way. Essentially, their partnership is aimed at making it possible for people without an insane amount of funding to train their own generative ML models with the highest performance and lowest cost.

**3/**

[**Microsoft knew about Bing AI‚Äôs misbehaviours in November last year**](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/what-did-they-know-and-when-did-they)

Yes, I know we featured Gary Marcus in our picks yesterday, but he‚Äôs just reeling out the good stuff right now so here he is again! He reports that **Microsoft** have pulled off the ultimate **publicity stunt**, releasing Bing AI [**whilst being well aware**](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/forum/all/this-ai-chatbot-sidney-is-misbehaving/e3d6a29f-06c9-441c-bc7d-51a68e856761?page=1) of its delusional, rude, and stubborn tendencies that we‚Äôve all been sharing over the past few weeks. (That second link will take you to evidence that a Microsoft person flagged it in November 2022.) It was more obvious than Gary seems to think, but taking a step back, it‚Äôs also *way more serious* than we seem to think. After all, this is the company that has become the face of AI safety and responsibility‚Ä¶

I thought we all knew Microsoft knew...

**4/**

[**OpenAI and Bain to bring business consulting expertise to AI**](https://www.bain.com/vector-digital/partnerships-alliance-ecosystem/openai-alliance/)

The consultants have waded in to get their piece of the pie, and it‚Äôs big! **OpenAI and** **Bain** - that massive business consulting firm you‚Äôve probably heard of - have partnered up to form a **services alliance**. The plan is to combine OpenAI‚Äôs tools with **Bain‚Äôs extensive business strategy expertise** to bring clarity to AI business applications. As a service provider, they‚Äôll take their customer‚Äôs business models, and pinpoint areas with the highest AI-value-add, deploy proof-of-concepts, and implement capabilities across the business.
