Hey folks, welcome to the 6,803 new folks joining since last week. We‚Äôre at 80k subscribers!!! Huge thank you to you all.

Today we have Google‚Äôs plans to save their search business, running LLMs on your browser, and 35 real ways people are using AI right now.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

PS: The links you see here are posted to [news.bensbites.co](http://news.bensbites.co?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-search-killer-by-google), the front page of AI, which we launched on Friday. We made the page a bit nicer, easier to scan, and things like greying out links you‚Äôve already visited.

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[The Google search killer is in the works‚Ä¶inside Google.](https://archive.vn/ti9Ns?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-search-killer-by-google)

Google went all action-hero and said no one could kill Google search because we‚Äôre doing it ourselves. It‚Äôs planning a**brand new search engine**that will be entirely different from the traditional search experience. Not much is said about this engine except the tagline ‚Äú**new A.I. technology in phones and homes all over the world.**‚Äù Probably a ‚Äúplay date‚Äù with Samsung as it threatened to use Bing in its devices as the default search engine.

And wait, I was just kidding. Google is not letting go of its most overachieving kid that easily. They are also working on adding many features to the\*\*traditional search under a project named Magi.\*\*This includes more images, direct financial transactions inside search, definite answers with a list of ads beneath etc.

While the team from Google said that not all decks would lead to a launch (which we already know, dear), here‚Äôs a quick list of some options they are looking at:

- GIFI - Image generation in image search results

- Search Along - Chat with access to search side by side

- Tivoli Tutor - Language learning with AI

- Google Earth + AI for mapping and exploration

- Music search by chat

**2/**

[Web LLM runs the Vicuna 7B entirely in your browser, and it‚Äôs very impressive.](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Apr/16/web-llm/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-search-killer-by-google)

You know, things like chatbots, then automatic agents feel like the next big thing. But most of these are**steps on a long hill**we‚Äôre climbing with AI. Another of those steps is making these AI models run locally and in browsers. Open-source releases let builders develop the locally running versions of LLMs, and now, we‚Äôve powerful**LLMs running in the browser**with no server support.[Github repo here.](https://github.com/mlc-ai/web-llm?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-search-killer-by-google)

What do you think will be the next step toward the big thing?

**3/**

[35 ways real people are using AI right now.](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/04/14/upshot/up-ai-uses.html?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-search-killer-by-google)**(**[non-paywalled version here](https://archive.vn/4fU5d?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-search-killer-by-google)**)**

I hate when productivity gurus mention a tool and say that the possibilities are endless. They have done that with Excel, then Notion, and now AI.

Who‚Äôll tell them that**I don‚Äôt need endless possibilities? I need examples**of using the damn thing. Right?

Now, I don‚Äôt know about Excel but I got you with AI. This article has**35 examples of people using AI**for gardening, doctor visits, designing spaceships and guess what? write Excel formulas. Check this, hit reply, and tell me if you got some inspo.
