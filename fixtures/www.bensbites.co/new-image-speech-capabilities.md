**1/** **[Midjourney v5 is released to level up your AI art skills](https://twitter.com/nickfloats/status/1636116959267004416)**

Remember that crazy period when some kind of generative art stuff came out and changed the world years ago 6 months ago, and then we all got distracted by language models? Just kidding, but hot on the heels of GPT-4 is **Midjourney v5**, and it‚Äôs equally as awesome. The thread linked above goes through a whole host of examples, and the results are stunning, albeit with subtle improvements over v4. It strikes me as better at capturing angular views of faces, is slightly less cartoonish, and captures the ‚Äòvibe‚Äô of the prompts more effectively. I‚Äôm keen to see assessments from the art experts out there!

**2/** **[AssemblyAI‚Äôs speech recognition model is the most powerful one yet](https://twitter.com/AssemblyAI/status/1636050346240884744)**

Time for Shazaam to take a leaf out of**AssemblyAI‚Äôs**book and level up their ability to spot song lyrics in a noisy room‚Ä¶ These guys are releasing Conformer-1, a**speech recognition model**that‚Äôs achieving near-human-level performance after being trained on 650,000 hours of audio data. That‚Äôs about an entire lifetime, or a whole day for all of the people that open this email added together‚Ä¶ It has 43% fewer errors on noisy data than other publications, a 29% speed-up at inference, and actually uses novel tech. Check out some live examples on their website[here](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/conformer-1/).

**3/** **[PwC bring generative AI to their lawyers](https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/news-room/press-releases/2023/pwc-announces-strategic-alliance-with-harvey-positioning-pwcs-legal-business-solutions-at-the-forefront-of-legal-generative-ai.html)**

OpenAI dived straight in with their demonstration that GPT-4 is a significantly better lawyer (amongst other things of course), and **PwC** is standing [ready](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-15/pwc-introduces-ai-chatbot-for-4-000-lawyers-to-speed-up-work#xj4y7vzkg) to put that to the test. Teaming up with the OpenAI-backed startup **Harvey** (back to that GOD DAMN brilliant Suits reference again), they‚Äôre using ChatGPT-powered tech to bring efficiency to due diligence and **regulatory compliance**. With **4,000+ lawyers globally**, PwC is making a big, commercial push to integrate generative AI into their business here.

**4/** **[The UK government throws a bit of money at the AI industry](https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/15/uk-spring-budget-chancellor-plans-1m-annual-ai-prize-quantum-investments-and-a-new-900m-exascale-computer/)**

It‚Äôs a warm and fuzzy feeling when people in power decide to take note of the importance of the nerdy work we all do - and the**UK government**seems to have done something along those lines in the Spring budget. With a number of**AI-specific allocations of money**, it‚Äôs a true demonstration of how AI is taking hold of the public discourse. My favourite bit is our very own Kaggle competition in the form of an annual**¬£1m prize for AI research**; there‚Äôs also ¬£3b in additional funding for high-growth companies (read: tech?); and the building of a quantum computing hub just for good order.
