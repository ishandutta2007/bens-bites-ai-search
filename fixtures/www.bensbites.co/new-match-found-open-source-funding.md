Hey folks, a big announcement from me today (will post it on [my Twitter](https://twitter.com/bentossell?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=new-match-found-open-source-funding) soon, and link here tomorrow anyway).

Today we‚Äôve got the AI report from Stanford University, LangChain raising $10M, text-to-app and two new AI accelerators have launched.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

p.s. we are hosting an AI hackathon with Every‚Äôs Dan Shipper 18th April.\

[Stanford University have mapped out the state of AI in 385 pages](https://www.theverge.com/23667752/ai-progress-2023-report-stanford-corporate-control?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=new-match-found-open-source-funding)

If you haven‚Äôt read**Stanford‚Äôs AI Index report**mapping the state of everything in 2023 then you defo should! Just kidding, it‚Äôs 385 goddamn pages, but luckily*The Verge*has captured the main bits for us, and we‚Äôll capture them even more succinctly here. Firstly, the main conclusion is that AI has well and truly**fallen into the hands of corporations**over academia and government, a scenario unfamiliar in most science domains. This can lead to the concentration of hazardous, profit-driven behaviour - in fact,**ethical misuse**in AI has seen a 26x increase since 2012. But‚Ä¶ this isn‚Äôt normalised for total use, and the number of bills passed involving the word ‚ÄúAI‚Äù has increased more than 10-fold, so maybe we‚Äôre on the right track?

Check out the link above for more deets, action-packed with pretty visuals.

[LangChain raise $10 million in funding to drive language models forward](https://blog.langchain.dev/announcing-our-10m-seed-round-led-by-benchmark/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=new-match-found-open-source-funding)

When open-source coding projects get an injection of funding, you know it‚Äôs a big deal. In fact, even if you‚Äôre not a coder, it‚Äôs been hard to get by over the past few months without hearing the word\*\*‚ÄúLangChain,‚Äù**so it‚Äôs no wonder they‚Äôve just been handed**$10 million\*\*. (If you don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs a Python framework that helps developers to get down and dirty with language models like ChatGPT, and it‚Äôs become*insanely popular*.) They plan to help make it easier for you to integrate language models into**front-end development**, want to help you prototype apps, and want to bridge the gap between that stage and getting to production. Oh, and**they‚Äôre hiring**‚Ä¶

[Imagica AI have produced a very cool-looking generative app tool](https://twitter.com/glebich/status/1643121195523637249?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=new-match-found-open-source-funding)

In case you haven‚Äôt noticed, I don‚Äôt tend to focus too much on tools that seem to get churned out every day - a case in point being**text-to-app**apps‚Ä¶ But I‚Äôve either been completely fooled by a super-slick demo video, or this is the best-looking one I‚Äôve seen so far. What‚Äôs drawing me in is the fact that it**guides the user through**: pick your topic, choose what you want it to do, and then give it a nudge with a cheeky bit of detail. I‚Äôm yet to give it a proper try though, so let me know!
