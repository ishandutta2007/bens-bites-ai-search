Hey folks! This is Ben‚Äôs Bites - an AI a day keeps the unhinged AGI away.

Off on a friend‚Äôs stag do (bachelor party) today/this weekend. So I‚Äôm in for a pretty heavy weekend I‚Äôd imagine, I hope yours is calmer üßò.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[How should AI systems behave, and who should decide?](https://openai.com/blog/how-should-ai-systems-behave/)

OpenAI is working to address complaints from users about politically **biased or offensive outputs from ChatGPT**. They use a two-step (not dance-related ü©∞ ) process to create ChatGPT, pre-training and fine-tuning. They collaborate with **reviewers** to maintain a feedback loop and **align AI with human values** and are working to address biases.

OpenAI wants to improve the default behaviour of ChatGPT, make it **customisable**, and include public input on topics like system behaviour and deployment policies. It‚Äôll be very interesting to see what these customisations look like!

**2/**

[The Capacity for Moral Self-Correction in Large Language Models](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1626260971227586560)

Anthropic also added one more weapon to their **bias busters** kit yesterday by releasing a paper on the ability to reduce bias from LLMs, and they have some good news.

- The models start to show the capability to self-correct at around 22B parameters and typically improve with increasing model size and RLHF training.

- Two techniques that work: instruction following (IF) prompt and chain of thought (CoT) reasoning. IF**reduces bias** by 43% and CoT by 84%.

The concern, though, is that they can sometimes over-correct if not checked. Check out this [thread](https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1626260971227586560?s=20) where they explain the three experiments they did with IF and CoT. The paper is [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07459).

**3/**

[The magic of OpenAI and GPT in your Coda docs](https://coda.io/product/ai-alpha)

Many document editors are adding AI to their stack these days. But let‚Äôs be honest, most of them are just AI autocomplete built into a text editor.

Well, that doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case for Coda. With their Alpha version of Coda AI, they‚Äôre merging the **building blocks of Coda docs with GPT3‚Äôs capabilities.** This modular approach removes the mundane work of organising AI-generated text and makes iterating way smoother. What‚Äôs more, you ask? It connects with 600+ other apps to integrate in your existing workflow. Definitely getting on that [waitlist.](https://coda.io/product/ai-alpha)

**[HyperWrite](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hyperwrite-ai-writing-com/kljjoeapehcmaphfcjkmbhkinoaopdnd)** \*\*(Sponsor)\*\*is the leading AI writing assistant that (learns from your writing) and (adapts to your context).

The Chrome extension (works on your favourite sites) and understands what you're doing, so the suggestions it provides are relevant and useful.

\*\*Write emails, memos, docs, and more with ease.\*\*Smart autocomplete, paragraph generation and rephrasing everywhere.
