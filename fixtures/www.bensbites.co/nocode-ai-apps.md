Howdy friends. It's Friday!! Coming at you from a very frosty Bedfordshire, UK. But, if you're in San Francisco (where it's also cold), Kazuki is hosting a Ben's Bites community meetup ([link](https://lu.ma/vaw88asa)) AND his ChatGPT Chrome extension just recently hit 6k users after being featured here and a few other places!

Ping me on Twitter with any cool things you see or have built! (@bentossell)

Let's get to it, it's already late Ben!

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- **Zapier‚Äôs OpenAI Integration has been officially released**! It lets you **create images and prompts directly through a Zap. You can build full no-code AI apps!!!** That is a huge deal. I showed you how with webhooks but this app now makes it like 10x simpler. **Set up a landing page, use a form for user input, have the Zapier OpenAI app do some magic (write emails, generate recipes, blog posts, social media posts) and put them into a Google Sheet, or display them on a website**! Oh and another cool thing is that Zapier built on top of Yohei‚Äôs unofficial app. AI is hugely community driven and it‚Äôs awesome to see. Can you tell I‚Äôm excited?! ([<u>get the app here</u>](https://zapier.com/apps/openai/integrations))
- Remember, **the app is ACTION only, meaning you need something to trigger it**. And you‚Äôll need your OpenAI API key which you can get from your account [<u>here</u>](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). ([<u>link</u>](https://zapier.com/apps/openai/integrations))

- This is a great post on **how someone had an idea and coded it in a few hours**. Oh and the **first line of code he‚Äôd ever written was generated from ChatGPT**. ‚ÄúChatGPT, Replit, and the AI Flywheel‚Äù. ([<u>link</u>](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/chatgpt-replit-ai-flywheel-nick-chapleau/))

- **McKinsey released their [<u>State of AI Report</u>](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/quantumblack/our-insights/the-state-of-ai-in-2022-and-a-half-decade-in-review)** **. Here‚Äôs a quick summary**: AI adoption has more than doubled since 2017, though the proportion of organisations using AI has plateaued between 50 and 60 per cent. A set of companies seeing the highest financial returns from AI are making larger investments in AI and engaging in advanced practices to enable scale and faster AI development. There is significant room to improve diversity in AI teams, and diverse teams correlate with outstanding performance. While AI use has increased, there have been no substantial increases in reported mitigation of any AI-related risks from 2019 to now. The proportion of respondents falling into the AI high performers group has remained steady at about 8 per cent, indicating that this group is achieving its superior results mainly from AI boosting top-line gains.
