Hey friends, the Hackathon projects are ready for voting! There have been so many impressive projects built this past week. I'm seriously floored with what you've all been building, in ONE WEEK ü§Ø.

Go and **[vote for your favourite submissions here](http://hackathon.bensbites.co/)**(you need to sign up to vote). Voting closes 11:59pm tonight Eastern Time then into our judges hands to determine prizes!

I'll shout out winners right here in a few days üòä

Let's get to it.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

**A "Copilot for X" guide** from the team that built the first real Copilot competitor. This article provides an overview of the considerations and steps necessary to build a "Copilot for X" product, using the example of Codeium, a Copilot alternative. ([link](https://lspace.swyx.io/p/what-building-copilot-for-x-really))

No Code AI Model Builder - **Create custom GPT-3 AI models in minutes, with no code**. This is cool. Upload a CSV and then use it in OpenAI's playground as a fine tuned model, or even use it with Zapier. ([link](https://no-code-ai-model-builder.com/))

This was from last week and somehow I missed it! **Richard Ngo on large language models, OpenAI**, and striving to make the future go well. ([link](https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/richard-ngo-large-language-models/))

A really good **overview of the AI market, what's happened and what's to come**. It's still early! ([link](https://zeneca33.substack.com/p/letter-32-artificial-intelligence))

### **üõ†Ô∏è Cool Tools**

- Diffusion Radio: **A 24/7 YouTube channel that livestreams AI-generated music**. When I went on the channel basically gave me mild concussion. I think, 'music' is a bit of an exaggeration. ([link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGRLOMf2hSc\&feature=youtu.be))
- Peech - The generative **AI video expert that creates your content**. ([link](https://www.peech-ai.com/))
- xpression camera 2.0 - **Generative AI for video chats** and live streams. ([link](https://xpressioncamera.com/))
- Gift Genie AI - **Get gift ideas by AI** from a giftee description. ([link](https://www.giftgenie.ai/))
- TweetGPT - A chrome extension that **generates tweets and replies using ChatGPT**. ([link](https://github.com/yaroslav-n/tweetGPT))
- Promptist - **A prompt interface for Stable Diffusion** that optimises user input into model-preferred prompts. ([link](https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/Promptist))
- Hairstyle AI - **Try new hairstyles** with the power of AI. ([link](https://www.hairstyleai.com/))
