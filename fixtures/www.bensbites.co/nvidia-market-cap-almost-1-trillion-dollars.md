[ChatGPT conversations can be shared publicly](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/7925741-chatgpt-shared-links-faq?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=nvidia-market-cap-is-almost-1-trillion-dollars)

Well, well, well, look who's back at shipping in the AI chat world - Friday morning we said OpenAI is making a feature where you can\*\*publicly share your ChatGPT conversations.\*\*And now it‚Äôs available for more plus users. They're calling it "Shared Links" and it's a neat little twist that'll let you share all those profound or just downright hilarious AI chats you've had.

Since these links are\*\*not indexed by search engines,**one of the angles I‚Äôm looking at them is**team collaboration.\*\*You create templates for your team with these shared links so each of your team members can just import that chat links and start working with an environment you have set up. Go on, give it a whirl, and let's see what sort of AI banter you've got going on in your world.

[Lawyer cites fake cases invented by ChatGPT, judge is not amused](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/27/lawyer-chatgpt/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=nvidia-market-cap-is-almost-1-trillion-dollars)

Oh dear, as I was getting excited about shared links, it looks like we've hit a bit of a snag with our AI friend ChatGPT. An ambitious lawyer thought he could pull a fast one by\*\*citing fake cases invented by the AI.\*\*Guess what, it didn't end well - the judge was less than impressed.

I mean, come on... really? Did the lawyer think the judge wouldn't notice or did the poor fella trust ChatGPT too much? Let's just take a moment to appreciate the irony - an AI chatbot that's been helping folks around the world with all kinds of queries ends up in a bit of a legal pickle itself.

Remember folks, AI is a tool,\*\*not a substitute for real, solid legal knowledge.\*\*These chatbots make up things too often. Here‚Äôs[another example](https://twitter.com/cwhowell123/status/1662501821133254656?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=nvidia-market-cap-is-almost-1-trillion-dollars)of a professor demonstrating this to his class. Let's chalk this one up as a lesson learned, shall we?

[AI Is Catapulting Nvidia Toward the $1 Trillion Club.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ai-is-catapulting-nvidia-toward-the-1-trillion-club-14f42380?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=nvidia-market-cap-is-almost-1-trillion-dollars)

Nvidia, let me tell you, is absolutely crushing it in the AI game. Three decades in the running, this tech titan is now knocking on the door of a cool\*\*trillion dollars in market cap.\*\*Can you believe it? It pumped up its market cap by a staggering $220B in a single day of after-hours trading.

And if that's not enough to make your head spin,**the big kahuna himself, the CEO, Jensen Huang**just dropped a flurry of[fresh announcements at Computex](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/28/nvidia-computex-jensen-huang/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=nvidia-market-cap-is-almost-1-trillion-dollars), the tech fiesta over in Taiwan. New GPUs, foundation models, AI training methodologies and more.

The man of the hour then moved on to deliver a[commencement speech](https://twitter.com/danqing_liu/status/1662657519888617476?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=nvidia-market-cap-is-almost-1-trillion-dollars)at the National Taiwan University. The buzz? It's been likened to Steve Jobs' legendary address at Stanford. You heard that right, Nvidia is not just playing in the big leagues, they're setting the pace.
