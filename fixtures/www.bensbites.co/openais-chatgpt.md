Seasons Greetings! Only 23 days to go before I gotta do my Xmas shopping.

After thousands of people watched my tutorial '[build an ai app with no-code](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1597952646232821760)', I've added a **LEARN** section, to gather all the useful walkthroughs people have. I'm building a site specific to this too ü´¢. The tutorial [already inspired people like Bram](https://twitter.com/bramk/status/1598253365057966080) to build a tool!

Ok, let's talk about ChatGPT.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- OpenAI trained a model called ChatGPT, which interacts in a conversational way. The dialogue format makes it **possible for ChatGPT to answer follow-up questions, admit its mistakes, challenge incorrect premises, and reject inappropriate requests**. Everyone‚Äôs talking about it, and rightly so! ([announcement link](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/))
- I collected a bunch of the below examples and use-cases that people have tested in a [Twitter thread here](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1598269692082151424).
  - How to **make money** and **write code**. ([link](https://twitter.com/nevmed/status/1598023273304182784))
  - Why **Google** is in trouble. ([link](https://twitter.com/jdjkelly/status/1598021488795586561))
  - Explaining and **fixing bugs in code**. ([link](https://twitter.com/amasad/status/1598042665375105024))
  - Generating **AI art prompts**. ([link](https://twitter.com/guyp/status/1598020781065527296))
  - How to use OpenAI's ChatGPT for **creative writing collaboration**. ([link](https://andrewmayneblog.wordpress.com/2022/11/30/collaborative-creative-writing-with-openais-chatgpt/))
  - It also divulges its **proprietary prompt**. ([link](https://twitter.com/goodside/status/1598253337400717313))
- [Check out the thread](https://twitter.com/bentossell/status/1598269692082151424) for more.
- **I was on the ‚ÄòWhere it Happens‚Äô podcast talking about the email, and AI broadly. ([link](https://youtu.be/yJKMJSgGa-0))**
- **New Distilled Stable Diffusion with 20x speed-up** (from 5.9 s to 0.9s) to be presented at NeurIPS by Stability AI. ([link](https://twitter.com/EMostaque/status/1598131202044866560))
- I got access to **Lexica's Aperture Model**!! I typed in a very short, non-detailed prompt and got some very very detailed responses. Check it out.
