\*"I'm gonna get you high today, 'cause it's Friday; you ain't got no job... and you ain't got shit to do".\*High on AI, amirite?!

But, Chris Tucker, we DO have jobs and we DO have shit to do! Luckily I've done the AI roundup for ya. So let's get to it.

*p.s. I'm planning ahead for Q1 2023, if you'd like to sponsor Ben's Bites in the New Year, go [here](https://sponsor.bensbites.co/) or just hit reply.*

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- **New and improved Embedding Model by OpenA**I, essentially keyword search on AI-created steroids. This new Embeddings model **replaces five separate models** for text search, text similarity, and code search, and **outperforms previous most capable model**, Davinci, at most tasks, while being **priced 99.8% lower**. ([link](https://openai.com/blog/new-and-improved-embedding-model/))*I'm hoping someone is capable of building semantic search with this for Ben's Bites Tracker (all the links I include here, in a Google Sheet) - if you can/have, let me know and we'll roll it out.*

  - Read the official OpenAI documentation. ([link](https://beta.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings))
- Riffusion - App for real-time music generation with Stable Diffusion. It has fine-tuned SD to**generate images of** **spectrograms**. **This spectrogram can then be converted to an audio clip** ü§Ø. ([link](https://github.com/hmartiro/riffusion-app))
