Hey everyone, this is Ben's Bites: giving you the little things in AI you need to know, every day.

Let's get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

If you‚Äôre looking for clues on **GPT-4‚Äôs release** then look no further than Ben‚Äôs Bites‚Ä¶ is what I wish I could say. Unfortunately, for those as eager as I am, Sam Altman‚Äôs [**StrictlyVC appearance**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop\&v=ebjkD1Om4uw) **didn‚Äôt give much away**. But what we did get was that people are *asking to be disappointed*; **generative video** is in the pipeline; and he thinks that future AI machines should be customisable to incorporate user‚Äôs biases - controversial! For more insights from the OpenAI chief, watch the full video - **[Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=57OU18cogJI\&t=1s) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop\&v=ebjkD1Om4uw)**.

Beyond Altman‚Äôs involvement with AI, he also gave us some clues (in part 1 above) about **Helion‚Äôs progress** on **fusion technology**, which everyone should care about. He suggested that we could get fusion-generated electricity on the grid by 2028, with ‚Äú*very good demos pretty soon‚Äù*. OK, back to tech now.

#### 2/

For a video of a **robot** spinning, bouncing, jumping, pushing, \*throwing,\*and flipping, as well as some seriously corny 80s acting, check out **Boston Dynamics‚Äô** [**most recent demo**](https://twitter.com/bostondynamics/status/1615728730969710592?s=12\&t=LuqfePezl-21Tm2qoRy_nA) of their robot, Atlas. With so much focus on marketable AI at the moment, it‚Äôs easy to forget the **awesome work going on in robotics**. I can‚Äôt help but imagine the possibilities of combining the OpenAI tech-of-knowledge with the robotics tech-of-action, as well as the potential dangers it could pose in the context of **AI alignment**.

#### 3/

In case you were wondering which humans represent the "H" in "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback", a [***Time* expos√©**](https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/) reported that it's been **Kenyan workers on less than $2/hour**, with the content reviews proving so **traumatising** - and the content sometimes **illegal** - that the outsourcing contract was cancelled prematurely. There appears to be more to the story though. People have been commenting things like; the average wage in Kenya is $1.25/hr and OpenAI paid Sama $12/hr but Sama paid it's workers $2/hr. ([Hacker News Thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=34426421))

#### 4/

It‚Äôs not every day that you‚Äôre lucky enough to hear about [**efficiency in the** **NHS**](https://www.htworld.co.uk/news/mental-health-chatbot-gains-medical-device-status-in-world-first/), but 130,000 patients have been using an **AI-generated mental health chat bot** that has a 93% accuracy in diagnosing psychological disorders. This type of technology has huge potential to alleviate the burden on the overstretched NHS by providing faster and cheaper assessment. Are we looking at the **future of GP services** beyond just mental health?
