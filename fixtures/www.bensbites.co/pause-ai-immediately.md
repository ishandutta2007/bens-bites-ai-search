Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got Replit + Google partnering (will they end up buying Replit üëÄ - I think they‚Äôll at least try!), Microsoft‚Äôs AI security, several open-source models from Cerebras and a petition to stop training new LLMs‚Äîyup, you read that correctly.

Some other big hitters that we can‚Äôt stuff into picks; Stratechery‚Äôs piece on OpenAI is great and Gpt4all is worth looking at for sure.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[Replit team up with Google to level up their coding copilot](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-03-28/google-partners-with-ai-startup-replit-to-take-on-microsoft-s-github)

This legit feels like a tag-team battle now! But this time, it‚Äôs not the stages of Smackdown or Raw, but the recent world of**coding copilots**. In the old-school corner we have OpenAI and Microsoft with the all-knowing, all-powerful GitHub copilot, and they‚Äôre being faced up to by the new kids on the block:**Replit and Google**. Replit is levelling up their recently-released coding assistant**Ghostwriter**by partnering with big tech to make use of their superior language models. And this time, it‚Äôs less of an ad-hoc copilot and more of an end-to-end project assistant. It can write the code, bug-fix it, make suggestions, write tests, deploy, review, and help with collaboration. I know which one I‚Äôd rather use‚Ä¶

[Microsoft releases a security copilot using AI to defend from attacks](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/ai-machine-learning/microsoft-security-copilot)

**Microsoft**are establishing themselves with AI in*every*aspect of the tech world with this one - a Security Copilot. I remember some months ago we reported on some start-ups using generative AI to solve**security attacks**, so I can‚Äôt help but feel sorry for them with the big dogs bulldozing their way into this. But hey ho, it is what it is! Microsoft‚Äôs AI copilot will be able to simplify the urgent understanding of attacks by**providing actionable insights**in minutes,**surfacing threats**before humans can spot them, and even predict the**most likely next move**of an attacker. This could actually be a major step in cybersecurity on a*biiiig*scale.

**3/**

[Cerebras Systems open-source a suite of small GPT models](https://twitter.com/CerebrasSystems/status/1640725880711569408)

ROLL UP, ROLL UP, the next passenger on the low-parameter-model train has just joined the crew, and it‚Äôs coming from**Cerebras Systems**. They‚Äôre releasing a whole menu of**GPT-driven models**ranging from 111M to 13B parameters, and they‚Äôre*fully***open-source**. The real kicker? According to them, they have the best accuracy relative to compute budget. The team has even delved into the research side of things, producing a new scaling law for model performance and compute. One more thing: they‚Äôre on Hugging Face, so everyone‚Äôs free to test their claims of quality. Get to it!

**4/**

[A temporary pause on training extra large language models](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/a-temporary-pause-on-training-extra)

STOP THE MACHINES!!! They screamed.

Just kidding, but Gary Marcus posted about a letter that proposes**a pause of 6 months**on training any new LLM bigger than GPT-4. If not, governments should come forward to stop new training.

The interesting part is about who has signed this letter: Gary‚Äôs tweet claims**signatures from leading AI researchers,**professors, and CEOs, including Elon Musk. Some other tweets also mentioned Yann LeCun from Meta (he previously said the ChatGPT is not that impressive), but he**denied participation**and disagreed with the letter. And now, users on Twitter are also[questioning](https://twitter.com/space_colonist/status/1640932869370712065)the authenticity of these signatures.

Is this a case of ‚Äòstop because you‚Äôre faster than me, no fair, let me catch up‚Äô or is it an actual proposal for humanity‚Äôs sake?!
