[Rewind](https://www.rewind.ai/), launched yesterday with a $10M [investment from a16z](https://www.rewind.ai/blog/launching-rewind). What’s it do?! **Find anything you’ve seen, said, or heard**.

ESM Metagenomic Atlas. [**Meta AI has created the first database that reveals the structures of the metagenomic world at the scale of hundreds of millions of proteins**](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/protein-folding-esmfold-metagenomics/). These proteins – which are found in microbes in the soil, deep in the ocean, and even inside our bodies – vastly outnumber those that make up animal and plant life. But they are the least understood proteins on earth.
