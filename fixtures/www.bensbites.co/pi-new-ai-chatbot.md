Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got a new player in the AI market from Reid Hoffman and ex-Deepmind employees, Khan Academy pushing hard with AI for education and new ChatGPT capabilities.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

**1/**

[Ex-DeepMind leads announce their companion chatbot, Pi](https://heypi.com/talk?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=pi-the-new-ai-on-the-block)

Guys, we have a new set of big guns on the block, and I think this is really worth taking note of. Yes, it‚Äôs another chatbot, but this one both acts and*feels*different to the rest.

Firstly, the minds behind this are star-studded:**Ex-DeepMind/Google**, a LinkedIn cofounder, OpenAI board member, and probably more. The bot is**Pi**, designed to be a**personal chatbot**that can develop into**virtual companionship**over time as it learns from your personal interactions.[According to Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2023/05/02/inflection-ai-ex-deepmind-launches-pi-chatbot/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=pi-the-new-ai-on-the-block), it‚Äôs there to play the active listener, talking through questions or problems over back-and-forth dialog it then remembers, getting to know its user over time.

One really cool feature: you can talk to your bot across**various platforms**, across which its memories of your interactions are maintained! Also, they say this isn‚Äôt even their most powerful model, which they insist is the best out there‚Ä¶

**2/**

[Khan Academy announce its educational chatbot for both students and teachers](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_the_amazing_ai_super_tutor_for_students_and_teachers/c?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=pi-the-new-ai-on-the-block)

I was trying to think of America‚Äôs answer to David Attenborough the other day, and I think I‚Äôve just decided that it‚Äôs Sal Khan - founder and frontman of**Khan Academy**, just about the world‚Äôs best education platform.

At a recent TED talk, Sal unveiled the academy‚Äôs new**AI educator**that doubles up as both a tutor and a teaching assistant. It‚Äôll have the ability to figure out where a student might have gone wrong; talk them through better approaches; guide them; pretend to be a historical figure; and even be a strong debate opponent. This**attitude to education is the right one**and could be transformative in driving students to excel in the future.

**3/**

[The ChatGPT Code Interpreter is an insanely efficient data analyst](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/it-is-starting-to-get-strange?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=pi-the-new-ai-on-the-block)

The**ChatGPT Code Interpreter**is starting to pick up a bit of attention in the[Twittersphere](https://twitter.com/emollick/status/1653382262799384576), and rightly so - its abilities are simply stunning. The tool is able to read files, let you download files, and execute its own code, and according to Ethan Mollick, it really comes into its own when you ask it to**analyse some data**.

Give it a big old dataset, and it‚Äôll come up with hypotheses, run statistical tests, do regressions, write about its results, and even provide you with**plots and visualisations**- all of which you can simply download.

The results are actually neat work with style and accuracy - potentially hours of data analyst work in minutes. It seems to only be available in Alpha mode at the moment, but it will probably be out in full soon, so keep your eyes peeled.
