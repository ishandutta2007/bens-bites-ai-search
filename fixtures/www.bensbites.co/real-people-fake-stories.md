Hey folks, Easter Friday and a green light to stuff my face full of chocolate this weekend‚Äîso, the usual then.

Today we have Google touching on search *with* AI, a fake sexual abuse story, AI in your earholes, Anthropic‚Äôs big $5Bn bet and a voice-enabled developer that can build a social network in minutes.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

p.s. have you tried out the new [Ben‚Äôs Bites Search](https://search.bensbites.co/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-chatbot-in-search) yet? It was built by one of our makers-in-residence, [Travis](https://twitter.com/transitive_bs?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-chatbot-in-search). It includes every link included in the email, choose semantic or keyword search.

[Google CEO Sundar Pichai Says Search to Include Chat AI](https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-says-search-to-feature-chat-ai-2fa0f54c?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-chatbot-in-search)**.**

So, Sundar Pichai was on the Wall Street Journal today. Will we be able to **talk to LLMs while searching? Sundar says, "Absolutely, yes.‚Äù**

Google is testing out some new chat-based features in their main Google search product. One example of these tests is the ability to ask follow-up questions. Perplexity has a similar approach to its search.

**2/**

[Defamed by ChatGPT - My Own Bizarre Experience with Artificiality of Artificial Intelligence](https://jonathanturley.org/2023/04/06/defamed-by-chatgpt-my-own-bizarre-experience-with-artificiality-of-artificial-intelligence/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-chatbot-in-search)

Alright, so get this:**ChatGPT gave a law professor's name when some journalist asked for examples of sexual abuse**. Not only did it give the name, but also a whole fake story with news articles.

Of course, the journalist found out it was all fake, and then they started talking about how the AI was trippin' and making stuff up. More fuel to the fire: Bing picked up on the news, misinterpreted it, and cited it as proof against the poor professor. It's a total mess.

The professor himself wrote a post explaining what really happened and his take on the whole situation. He goes off on some political tangent, but let me just say this: don't trust ChatGPT too much, especially when it comes to people. Be careful out there, y'all.

**3/**

[Apollo - A ChatGPT-powered app for real-time knowledge through your headphones](https://twitter.com/localghost/status/1644068688902127616?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-chatbot-in-search)

Aaron and his AI demos. Every time he shows one, I‚Äôm amazed.

This time, he made a**personal search engine for your AirPods**(as long as you don‚Äôt lose them every 2 minutes like me)! And now you can access ALL the knowledge in the world just by asking a question into thin air.

Seriously, this is some superhuman-level stuff. You plug in the AirPods and become Dr. Strange. I can't wait for Aaron to make it available for everyone to use.

**4/**

[Anthropic‚Äôs $5B, 4-year plan to take on OpenAI](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/06/anthropics-5b-4-year-plan-to-take-on-openai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=google-s-chatbot-in-search)

TechCrunch got a scoop on Anthropic, and its plans to train a powerful model. It‚Äôs from their deck that discloses previous fundraises from a ‚Äúconfidential investor.‚Äù Adding to that are Google and‚Ä¶ Alameda (yup, the FTX company). The deck says that Alameda had no say in their research and expects their shares to be disposed of in the bankruptcy proceedings.

More on the model: They are calling it**Claude Next**for now and aim it to be**10x bigger than the biggest models**today (GPT-40?!). The expected timeframe is the next 18 months, with a claim that\*‚Äúcompanies that train the best 2025/26 models will be too far ahead for anyone to catch up in subsequent cycles.‚Äù\*
