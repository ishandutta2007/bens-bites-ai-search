Hello and welcome to Ben's Bites, the #1 daily AI newsletter. Like your attention span, it's short and excitable.

Let's get to it.

*p.s. I'm looking to hire a writer. Reply to this email and rewrite today's 'Ben's picks' section. Make it casual, witty and informative, like talking to a friend. Kind of a mixture of Milk Road, Mailbrew and The Hustle. (lol this is like a prompt). Looking for someone who loves this space and is always checking out new things.

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

The real winner in AI so far? Microsoft.**[Microsoft eyes $10 billion bet on ChatGPT](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/09/2023/microsoft-eyes-10-billion-bet-on-chatgpt).**

*Whew*, **who saw that coming?!** Not me. A little recap of *how well* they're doing:

- $1bn in OpenAI (2019)
- Owns GitHub which released Copilot
- Dalle powers Bing Image Creator
- Valle which produces an AI voice from 3s of input
- GPT in Word, PowerPoint, Outlook etc
- GPT-powered Bing
- $10bn, 49% stake in OpenAI + 75% profit

The last point is from the recent news reported by Semafor. Apparently, **Microsoft is eyeing up a $10bn deal with OpenAI. They'd get 49% ownership** (49% to investors and 2% to OpenAI's non-profit parent).

Also **75% of profits would go to Microsoft** until it recoups it's investment.

Satya Nadella is a boss.

Oh and you may have overlooked VALL-E which I included a few days ago. Trained on 60k hours of English speech, it can **generate speech in any voice from only 3s of that voice input.**([link](https://valle-demo.github.io/)) A good post on it [here](https://mpost.io/vall-e-microsofts-new-zero-shot-text-to-speech-model-can-duplicate-everyones-voice-in-three-seconds/).

Is this huge win for Microsoft somewhat of a loss for OpenAI and the rest of us? I guess we will wait to find out.

Oh, and don't feel bad for Google sitting in their code red bunker.

- Google paid ~$650M to acquire DeepMind in 2014
- OpenAI is currently "valued" $29 Bn
- OpenAI's revenue is "tens of millions"
- DeepMind's 2020 revenue was $1.13 Bn and was profitable (*[source](https://twitter.com/borrowed_ideas/status/1612643554337390594)*)

This year will be a big one for Microsoft vs Google. Who you betting on?
