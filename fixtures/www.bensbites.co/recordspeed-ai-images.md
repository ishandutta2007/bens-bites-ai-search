# Record-speed AI images

### PLUS: China panicking, Microsoft's secret and some fun

Hey folks, last full day in Milan for me, so I need to cram in a pizza ASAP. I'm loaded up with podcasts and articles for the journey home tomorrow (all AI-related obviously). Food last night was an all-round 8/10 - crispy prawn tacos were a *dream.*

See ya next week. Let's get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Qualcomm demo record-speed AI image generation on a mobile**](https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/23/23611668/ai-image-stable-diffusion-mobile-android-qualcomm-fastest)

I remember at some point in secondary school (high school for our friends across the pond) I got the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs slimmest phone‚Äù, and then suddenly things got *really small really quickly*, and now I realise it really wasn‚Äôt that slim üôÅ. Anyway, are we starting to see the same with AI? **Qualcomm** demonstrated using **AI image generation on a mobile phone** whilst simultaneously hitting **record speeds** for doing so, and the results look spot on. Being able to generate AI images on your phone would be really cool. One big caveat though: it looks like the demo was on hardware with custom optimization that‚Äôs not publicly available‚Ä¶ Hmm.

**2/**

[**Photorealistic 3D photo rendering using NeRF**](https://twitter.com/lumalabsai/status/1628832654840979457?s=12\&t=HGCqSH9MlRxEMSHyuV8nKQ)

Whenever I see these **NeRF** shots of images it makes me feel really weird but in an excitable and good way! It‚Äôs so cool how the camera develops this ability to make it **feel like you‚Äôre really in the scene**, poking and prodding around and viewing 3D objects at all angles. The Luma AI team have taken this technology to the next level, showing **volumetric photorealistic 3D rendering** in real time. To really see how awesome this is, click the [**link**](https://twitter.com/lumalabsai/status/1628832654840979457?s=12\&t=HGCqSH9MlRxEMSHyuV8nKQ) and check out the demo.

**3/**

[**Pinecone is becoming the MongoDB for AI**](https://sacra.com/research/pinecone-mongodb-of-ai/)

Writing sentences like that pick header often makes me wonder what new-joiners to the tech world must be thinking about the wacky names we come up with. But we love ‚Äòem. For those who don‚Äôt know, the **AI language models**doing the rounds rely heavily on **vector embeddings** - sentences converted to numeric vectors. And **Pinecone** seems to have established itself as the leader in providing storage and retrieval of embeddings, with developer usage doing **20x** since ChatGPT hit the scene. That‚Äôs *huge*. But there‚Äôs a big, important question: Like MongoDB, will Pinecone maintain product stickiness and stand strong in the face of Big Tech?

**4/**

[**Some very funny logo modifications using AI**](https://twitter.com/fofrai/status/1628882166900744194?s=12\&t=2wJb6MMA_F6CmLIjck---w)

Time to finish the week on a light-hearted note that‚Äôll send you into a weekend of fun. ControlNet is a new model that allows you to take control of parts of an image, and then let AI work its magic on the rest. This Twitter thread shows someone‚Äôs experiments passing famous logos (Starbucks, Burger King etc) through ControlNet and seeing what AI can muster up‚Ä¶ Some of the results are hilarious, especially the Starbucks one for me ü§£. Happy Friday all!
