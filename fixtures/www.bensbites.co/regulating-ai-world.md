Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got OpenAI talking about regulation again, going international this time. Intel on the other hand, is training a 1T parameter model on scientific knowledge with its supercomputer.

Meta comes in with their multilingual Ai model that can talk in 1000 languages, and Naval brings a new app to the social media market: Airchat.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

From our sponsor:

**The folks at Zapier are going beyond just talking about AI; they‚Äôre making it actionable.**

Last week, I mentioned Zapier‚Äôs AI Beta features‚Äî[creating zaps with natural English and bringing coding abilities to customize your zaps.](https://zapier.com/ai?utm_campaign=-gbl-eng-ooc-ai_may2023_webinar-\&utm_medium=paid\&utm_source=bens_bites) But if there‚Äôs one thing I know about automation, it‚Äôs that most folks haven‚Äôt even scraped the surface when it comes to what‚Äôs possible. Add AI-powered features into the mix, and it‚Äôs a whole new ballgame.

Luckily, Zapier is here to provide some inspiration. In just a few hours, Zapier is inviting folks to see how they're using AI and Zapier together across departments‚Äîfrom marketing and sales to customer success, support, and even revenue operations. [Sign up for the webinar](https://zapier.com/resources/webinar/leaders-using-ai?utm_campaign=-gbl-eng-ooc-ai_may2023_webinar-\&utm_medium=paid\&utm_source=bens_bites) to see how AI can supercharge your impact. And don‚Äôt worry if you can‚Äôt make the live event. Just register before the event starts, and Zapier will send the recording once the webinar wraps up.

[OpenAI suggest an international regulatory body for generative AI](https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/22/openai-leaders-propose-international-regulatory-body-for-ai/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=regulating-ai-all-over-the-world)

Ahhh finally, a sensible regulatory suggestion for generative AI!**OpenAI**chiefs have put forward the proposition for an**international regulatory body**, similar to that governing nuclear power. And given that we haven‚Äôt been nuked yet, I guess that works, right‚Ä¶? They argue that we**can‚Äôt expect existing authorities**to adequately rein in the technology - this is fair and logical, we need cross-border work to help this going forward. And they also recommend**tracking compute power and energy usage**as a method for observation. That being said, we might have been taken over by robots by the time something like this can get drawn up.

[Meta‚Äôs new language model recognises 10x more languages](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/05/22/1073471/metas-new-ai-models-can-recognize-and-produce-speech-for-more-than-1000-languages/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=regulating-ai-all-over-the-world)

It‚Äôs**Meta‚Äôs**turn again to make a big AI announcement today, and this one has a big old focus on**international language**, and you‚Äôll never guess what was used to train it. Translations of the Bible‚Ä¶ Might we see a wave of theism in Silicon Valley? Anyway, it can**communicate in 1000 languages**(10x the current best) and understand 3000 more! On top of this, they reckon it**halves the error rate**of OpenAI‚Äôs Whisper, but unfortunately has 0.7% more biassed words. That‚Äôs not bad going anyhow!

**3/**

[Intel has a 1T parameter model in the pipeline with a focus on science](https://wccftech.com/intel-aurora-genai-chatgpt-competitor-generative-ai-model-with-1-trillion-parameters/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=regulating-ai-all-over-the-world)

Well, OpenAI has been well and truly pipped on the parameter count leaderboard with this one. Alongside a brand new**two exaflop supercomputer,** **Intel**has released plans to train a**1 Trillion parameter**generative AI model, and it‚Äôs all things science.

Using models called Megatron (great name) and DeepSpeed, it‚Äôll be trained on general and\*\*scientific text, code, and (un)structured data from a whole host of scientific disciplines.\*\*With plans to apply it to a load of scientific disciplines from chemistry to medicine, I can‚Äôt wait to see how this one pans out. Keep it on your radar! (Might take some time to train though‚Ä¶)

[**Naval is building a social media app - Airchat.**](https://twitter.com/naval/status/1660405285943668736?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=regulating-ai-all-over-the-world)

Naval Ravikant is back to building. You heard it right. On top of that, it‚Äôs a social media app. In the classic Naval style tweet, he introduced \*\*Airchat - The social media with chit-chat, banter, and easy laughter.\*\*It‚Äôs limited access on iOS only for now, with Android in the making.

But what about AI? Yup, get ready to get your mind blown because it has the **sleekest AI translation experience and art generations.** Check [this video](https://twitter.com/altryne/status/1660697297204957186?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=regulating-ai-all-over-the-world) of people chatting in dozen plus languages at the same time.

It‚Äôs async and I don‚Äôt know how that works, but I‚Äôm excited about this.
