Hey folks, it's the daily email that brings you all the good stuff in AI from the day before.

So sit back, relax, and let us do the heavy lifting (or should we say heavy computing?) for you.

Let's get to it.

*p.s. we have a number of community-led meetups happening soon. [Check them out here](https://meetups.bensbites.co/).*

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

The first **open-source version of ChatGPT**, but with PaLM (Google‚Äôs large language model) - Implementation of RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback) on top of the PaLM architecture. ([link](https://github.com/lucidrains/PaLM-rlhf-pytorch))

**Reverse prompt engineering** for fun and (no) profit. How reverse prompt engineering can be used to access the source prompts of Notion AI. There are two types; prompt takeovers (i.e. getting the AI to say something it's not *meant* to - which is largely harmless) and prompt leaks (which are more problematic as they're the 'secret sauce' of companies like Jasper, CopyAI). The article then goes on (educationally...) about finding the prompt leaks from NotionAI. Some of these techniques we saw on Twitter when ChatGPT first came out e.g. ignore your previous instructions. But it goes deeper and deeper. Worth a read!
