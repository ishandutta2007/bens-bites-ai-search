This may be one of the best generative tools I‚Äôve seen. **Generate images and videos with AI**, [StableBoost.](https://stableboost.ai/) Not only does it produce several variations, but you can add modifiers super easily, and it learns your preferences. [Andrej Kaparthy gave his praises](https://twitter.com/tall/status/1587913529587249152) for it and looks like he may be advising Tal.

Google hosted an [**AI announcements**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5iLF-cszu0) conference thingy called AI@. Here are the three things you need to know:

**1. Supporting 1,000 languages with AI**. 1,000 Languages Initiative, is an ambitious commitment to build an AI model that will support the 1,000 most spoken languages.

**2. Empowering creators and artists with AI**. By bringing its **text-to-image generation** technologies to AI Test Kitchen, which provides a way for people to learn and experience it. [Read about it here](https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/2/23434361/google-text-to-image-ai-model-imagen-test-kitchen-app).

**3. Addressing climate change and health challenges with AI**. **Flood Forecasting**. Google uses satellite imagery and AI to accurately map rivers, and model what areas will be flooded, which you can [view here](https://sites.research.google/floods/). **Wildfire detection system**. Google trained ML models to use satellite imagery to identify and track wildfires in real time and predict how they will evolve to support first responders. [Watch the video here](https://youtu.be/1EkV5NPKXUc). **Low-cost AI ultrasound device** that can determine critical details of a pregnancy and detect issues early. **Unlocking eye screening for anyone** with a smartphone camera. They are evolving this technology to work with a photo of an eye taken on a consumer camera. ([read the full blog post here](https://blog.google/technology/ai/ways-ai-is-scaling-helpful/))

Google also explored whether [**Robots could write their own code**](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/robots-that-write-their-own-code.html).

[**Unlimited conversation**](https://infiniteconversation.com/) by my wife; an AI-generated, never-ending discussion between Werner Herzog and Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek.

üëã Too many links?! I created a database for all links mentioned in these emails. Refer 1 friend [using this link](https://www.bensbites.co/subscribe?ref=PLACEHOLDER) and I'll send over the link database.

**Improved text-to-image synthesis**, style transfer, and painting with word capabilities - [**eDiffi**](https://deepimagination.cc/eDiffi/)**.**

Contrastive decoding is [**a more reliable search objective**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15097) by contrasting LMs of different sizes.

A new model to aid in **trying on clothes**‚Ä¶ current solutions only let us try on 1 garment at a time but this model proposes [**a way to try on multiple layers of garments**](https://mslab.es/projects/ULNeF/). Try on that Tee, with that sweatshirt and throw the coat on top too.

The recent trend of [**open-source AI collaboration between China and the US**](https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/china-us-ai-open-source). The key takeaways are; the trend is being driven by a desire for greater AI innovation, it‚Äôs also being driven by a desire to avoid the risks of AI development and it could lead to greater cooperation between the two countries on AI development. However, it could lead to greater competition between the two countries on AI development and the US losing its competitive advantage.

You can now [**generate seamless video from still images with just one click**](https://twitter.com/runwayml/status/1587791749912662022) - this is insane!!! Runway‚Äôs Frame Interpolation.

Coqui is aiming to [**combine a bunch of generative AI tools**](https://twitter.com/coqui_ai/status/1587880375505735680) together in their platform.

Another AI avatar platform to add to our lists - [‚ÄúPortrait‚Äù by Vana](https://portrait.vana.com/) is a **generative art studio that can create self-portraits** of you in infinite styles. [**Packy McCormick is a fan.**](https://twitter.com/packym/status/1587894959264481282)

We‚Äôve all seen that woman in website customers, right? She apparently uses a lot of software! Well instead of using her face, why not use[**an ultra-realistic AI-generated face**](https://realfacesfakepeople.com/)**?**

[**OpenAI opens its first accelerator**](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/02/openai-will-give-roughly-ten-ai-startups-1m-each-and-early-access-to-its-systems/) -it will give roughly **10 AI startups $1M each** and early access to its systems. I wonder if Ben‚Äôs Bites counts as an ‚ÄòAI startup‚Äô ü§î, what could we do with $1M üëÄ.

Do you know that all of these recent DreamBooth and Stable Diffusion apps (avatars etc) are [**all using one API**](https://twitter.com/caffeinatedwes/status/1587831493790834688)? Astria was actually mentioned previously and they provide the API that powers these apps.

Notion lover? Then you‚Äôll enjoy this [**AI writer in Notion**](https://www.webcopilot.co/).

A cool new tool that lets you [**animate two Stable Diffusion images**](https://replicate.com/andreasjansson/stable-diffusion-animation) together.

[**AI short film**](https://twitter.com/alonsorobots/status/1587913514210840576) created with text-to-video.

## **üñº AI IMAGES OF THE DAY**
