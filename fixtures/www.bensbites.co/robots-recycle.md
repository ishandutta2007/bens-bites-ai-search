Hey folks, today, the Python foundation is concerned about staying open-source, OpenAI has a new image generation model, Google built robots that recycle and Italy is giving OpenAI orders‚Ä¶

Let‚Äôs get to it.

[The Python foundation is seriously concerned about its ability to stay open-source](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-eus-proposed-cra-law-may-have.html?m=1\&utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=robots-that-recycle)

Houston, we have a problem! Now this isn‚Äôt really AI-related per se, but it‚Äôll certainly be of interest to anyone involved with AI. The EU has drafted a**Cyber Resilience Act**, and according to the people who manage**Python**, if enacted it could**question their ability to keep it open-source**. Yeah, you heard that right. Because it doesn‚Äôt distinguish between large corporates and not-for-profits, authors of**open-source projects**may end up bearing financial and legal responsibility for*any*tech built using it. That includes the Python foundation itself‚Ä¶ Keep your eyes peeled for petitions to sign, and write to your local MEP if you‚Äôre in the EU!

[OpenAI have found a generative image model that could be the next big thing](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/openai-looks-beyond-diffusion-with-consistency-based-image-generator/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=robots-that-recycle)

Believe it or not, despite the success of ChatGPT,**OpenAI**does still care about AI art and**image generation**! And their latest is definitely something worth keeping an eye on. They[recently published](https://github.com/openai/consistency_models?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=robots-that-recycle)something called a**Consistency Model**(it‚Äôs super mathsy, don‚Äôt bother) that reaches its final output in a handful of steps rather than thousands. The results aren‚Äôt as good as Midjourney and Stable Diffusion*yet*, but if they manage to get the technique to the same levels of image quality they‚Äôll leapfrog straight into the lead. The first to succeed at speeding things up will be the first to hit mobiles and everyday applications - let the races begin!

[Google AI researchers build robots that can sort recycling](https://twitter.com/hausman_k/status/1646188261361209345)

I always find that**robotics**researchers choose the strangest tasks to demonstrate their abilities, like arranging shaped blocks and‚Ä¶ sorting rubbish bins. Using deep reinforcement learning, these guys at**Google AI**have managed to produce something pretty damn cool. The robots are**able to effectively sort rubbish**in real offices, reducing the contamination rates by 50%. Just watch those creepy little things zooming around doing our recycling for us, it‚Äôs great!

[Italy gives OpenAI an initial to-do list for lifting ChatGPT suspension order.](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/12/chatgpt-italy-gdpr-order/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=robots-that-recycle)

Among a dozen other things and legal clarifications here‚Äôre a few things Open AI needs to do to operate in the country:

- Provide ways to ask for corrections of disinformation generated by ChatGPT (or else have the data deleted) by Apr 30.

- Conduct a local awareness campaign to inform Italians that it's processing their information to train its AIs by May 15.

- Immediate adoption of age gating to prevent minors from accessing the tech and move to more robust age verification measures by September 30.

I‚Äôm blocking chatGPT in my house until they can give me; unlimited free credits, early access to every release and a bag of cash. Hope they comply with Italy AND Ben‚Äôs Bites HQ.
