Hi, this is Ben‚Äôs Bites, your simple summary of what‚Äôs going on in AI. Written with AI.

Today we‚Äôve got:

- Open-source and its role in AI
- Guided Diffusion Models - huh?! See below üòâ
- Product Roundup

### The Role of Open Source in AI

Swyx wrote a post titled ‚ÄúHow Open Source is eating AI‚Äù and why open-sourcing other forms of AI might create more opportunities:

- **Improving documentation**. Lots of research is very technical, for widespread adoption we need to dumb down.
- **Sharing prompts**. People are more reluctant to share their prompts than they are startup ideas. Hopefully people get over this and more sharing of prompts helps everyone advance their skills.
- **New UIs** and **improving** **accessibility**. We need these things to be super easy to use! Remember how hard crypto has been for ‚Äònormies‚Äô.

### Guided Diffusion Models

A paper was released titled ‚ÄúOn Distillation of Guided Diffusion Models‚Äù - sounds technical, doesn‚Äôt it?! We broke it down for you:

Firstly, what is a ‚ÄòClassifier-free guided diffusion model‚Äô?

It‚Äôs a type of machine learning model that‚Äôs effective at high-resolution image generation.

But they‚Äôre expensive to run.

However, if you have a model that you've already trained, you can use that to create a new model that is more accurate.

So basically a new model is created that is simpler and requires fewer sampling steps to complete.

The result? It can generate images up to 256 times faster than the original.

It took 4 years for Michelangelo (not Michael Angelo) to complete the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. Now the new-age AI-enabled Michelangelo would be able to do it in 5.7 days!! (if my calculations are correct)

Pieter Levels is building in public again. He wrote how he turned his **InteriorAI** site into a money-making tool for **interior design inspiration**. Good job I've just finished my house üòí.

**Imagen Video.** Essentially really really good **text-to-video by Google**. It even boasts ‚Äúnot only capable of generating videos of high fidelity, but also having a high degree of controllability and world knowledge, including the ability to generate diverse videos and text animations in various artistic styles and with 3D object understanding.‚Äù

A complimentary release from Google is Phenaki. This is another text-to-video piece of magic but this **includes the ability to use different prompts throughout**. So you can create stories, movies, comics, anime, romance, you name it!
