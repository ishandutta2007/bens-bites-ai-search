Ello ello, and welcome to the 104 new folk joining us since yesterday.

We've got a big feast today, take it slow, and peruse at your own pace, perhaps you've got a load of pointless meetings today and you want to just look at cool stuff. Well, I've got you.

Let's get to it.

*p.s. Emad from StabilityAI is doing an [AMA on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/yw6s1i/d_ama_the_stability_ai_team/) today if you wanna ask any Qs (in between meetings, of course*üòè\*).\*

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

Galactica launched with a big bang (üòâ). [<u>**A large language model for science**</u>](https://galactica.org/) that can **summarise academic literature, solve math problems, generate Wiki articles, write scientific code, annotate molecules and proteins**, and more.

You can use the [<u>**demo on Hugging Face**</u>](https://huggingface.co/spaces/shi-labs/Versatile-Diffusion).
