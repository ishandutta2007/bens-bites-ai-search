Hey folks - apologies for the late send yesterday. Austin's nightlife took hold of me! Flying back today and didn't get to see a great deal of the city this week as they had a freak winter storm. I experienced freezing rain for the first time ever!

Let's get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**Bing to incorporate ChatGPT imminently?**](https://www.semafor.com/article/02/01/2023/chatgpt-is-about-to-get-even-better-and-microsofts-bing-could-win-big)

The big-gun AI races have *reeeaaally* heated up. After Teams is officially incorporating ChatGPT, it sounds like **Bing is about to do the same**with the long-awaited **GPT-4**.

Watch out **Google**, who are being **unnervingly quiet**‚Ä¶ It kinda feels like they‚Äôre just gonna jump out with something no one (or everyone?) is expecting. [**According to Bloomberg**](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-02/google-shares-gain-as-revenue-meets-analyst-estimates#xj4y7vzkg), this sort of AI technology is going to become ‚Äúpart of their core services in the coming weeks/months.‚Äù Does that mean **Google‚Äôs version of ChatGPT**? We‚Äôll have to wait and see.

Bloomberg‚Äôs article without the paywall is [**here**](https://archive.ph/pOHEO#selection-4731.0-4735.156).

**2/**

[**AI-generated article summaries from hovering over a link**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/01/summari-pivots-to-ai-generated-link-previews-that-really-click/)

The original guys who brought us **article-summary-tech** are back in town, in business, on the block, and whatever else you want to say. Instead of becoming another AI summary extension, they are pivoting to generating an **article summary when you hover your mouse over a link**. Kinda like Wikipedia pop-ups but AI-generated.

They‚Äôre aiming to address that daunting prospect of clicking into links only to be disappointed in the content or to just end up leaving it on your toolbar to perpetuity. I can totally see this becoming big stuff.

**3/**

[**Find similar-sounding songs with Maroofy**](https://twitter.com/subby_tech/status/1621293770779287554?s=12\&t=7K8CZt-GtU3xKaB5VeikQw)

I dunno about you guys, but when I find a song I‚Äôve fallen for, I listen to it back to back, eventually reaching a love-hate stage. Then the sick-and-tired stage.

For those of you like me, [**Maroofy**](https://maroofy.com/) provides some pretty cool tech to help you move on. **Enter a song**you like, and it finds ***similar-sounding*** **songs**. Not just the same artist or genre, but the same vibes. So that you can listen to sounds you love without hating a poor, innocent song!

**4/**

[**Friday Fun: Human-animal portraits using AI art**](https://twitter.com/linusekenstam/status/1621297496491450368?s=12\&t=7K8CZt-GtU3xKaB5VeikQw)

For a bit of Friday Fun-time, check out this pretty funny thread using generative AI to produce **human-animal portraits**. It also doubles up as a best-in-class tutorial on **how to guide prompts** to a desired outcome.

**Marketers**, if someone paid you up to $100 for 7 minutes of your time, would you do it?

[**Wynter**](https://wynter.com/panelists/join-panel?utm_source=newsletters\&utm_medium=email\&utm_campaign=benbites)**(Sponsor)** is a message-testing platform, and they need feedback from marketing executives and managers. They'll pay you between $15 - $100 per survey, $45-$100 if you're a **marketing leader,** and at most, the surveys take 7 minutes.\
