### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

Worth a read: DeepMind's CEO, Demis Hassabis, talks to TIME about AI (duh). A few folks have been pointing out the sparrow in the room...no seriously, **Sparrow is DeepMind's Chatbot that they're running a closed beta for in 2023**. No doubt a response to ChatGPT. It'll be able to cite sources in its responses, which ChatGPT may be able to do - although we've not been allowed to do that (remember the browing:disabled prompt that it has?). Another interesting part of this interview is when Hassabis said \*‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting into an era where we have to start thinking about the freeloaders, or people who are reading but not contributing to that information base,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúAnd that includes nation states as well.‚Äù He declines to name which states he means‚Äî‚Äúit‚Äôs pretty obvious, who you might think‚Äù‚Äîbut he suggests that **the AI industry‚Äôs culture of publishing its findings openly may soon need to end**."\*Let's see what happens!

Everyone likes to pretend they know about the new capabilities that **GPT-4**can bring. "Apparently it can look after a house plant", "It can heal animal wounds by listening to their breath", "It can run a billion dollar company by itself" and on and on the rumours swirl. BUT, we're going to have to wait. It's release was originally planned for late Q4 2022/Q1 2023 which may move back slightly if I'm reading [this tweet correctly](https://twitter.com/readkrystalhu/status/1613761499612479489)... 'OpenAI‚Äôs **GPT-4 will launch only when** they can do it safely & responsibly. ‚ÄúIn general we are going to release technology much more slowly than people would like. We're going to sit on it for much longer..."' Oh and a video model is apparently in the works too...!

#### 3/

We all know **Reid Hoffman;** PayPal, Linkedin and Greylock. He's started a podcast with a familiar co-host, ChatGPT. Yup, it's happening folks. In the first episode, ChatGPT and Reid start with self-reflection by talking about the Turing Test, and expand into AI‚Äôs potential impact across several creative fields. Talking AI with AI - **ChatGPT as a podcast guest.** ([<u>link</u>](https://greylock.com/greymatter/reid-hoffman-chatbots-talking-ai-with-ai/))

#### 4/

I just have to proudly say this - my wife asked if I wanted a McDonald's breakfast this morning and I said NO. Can I get a virtual high five?! That's pretty insane will power I'd say. Anyway... **[McDonalds just released an advertisement for Lunar New Year 2023 where Luma AI NeRF + Fields Editor is used](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34KeBnSwvmc\&feature=youtu.be)**. p.s. she brought home a hash brown for me anyway. So I get the pleasure of saying no and pleasure of eating the best part. Bah de bah bah bah, I'm lovin' it. Sorry, had to.
