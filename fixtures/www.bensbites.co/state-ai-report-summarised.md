Hi friends, this is Ben‚Äôs Bites, walking you through the sunny side of AI, avoiding the waffle and getting straight to the meat (or vegan alternative).

**Today we‚Äôve got:**

- State of AI Report
- Diagnosing patients based on your voice
- Product Roundup
- AI images of the day

### **The State of AI Report**

Nathan Benaich and Ian Hogarth (AI investors) put together a mammoth 113 slide report all about AI.

We read it, so you don't need to. Here's the key takeaways you need to know:

**1. Speed & Capability**

Research collectives have open-sourced breakthrough AI language, text-to-image and protein (not protein powder) models at a rapid pace. The pace is so fast that text-to-video capabilities are being released within days of each other.

But these are from Meta and Google. Open-source communities are surely soon to follow.

**AI art has taken the internet by storm**. Technology that was in the hands of few, is now in the hands of everyone with a smartphone/laptop.

Nvidia still holds the top spot for compute power. They‚Äôre used**90x more than 5 major AI chip startups combined**.

Size really does matter! (with computers at least)

**2. Breakthroughs**

LLM (Large Language Models) can learn the language of proteins and be used for their generation and structure prediction.

Also, they learnt about Covid (sorry I mentioned it) which was used to predict high-risk Covid-19 variants far before the WHO designated them as variants.

How? The model ingests the protein and predicts its immune escape and fitness. So basically, **AI can understand chemicals present in plants and can help discover new drugs and predict their properties**. AI-first drug discovery companies have made 18 assets that are in active clinical trials today. Up from 0 only 2 years ago.

And to top off how AI is revolutionizing science, it can learn to **control nuclear fusion reactors.**

LLMs are also **learning to use software tools**. They can be trained to interact with search engines, web apps, and other software. Improved by watching us use them üëÄ.

**3. Companies & Funding.**

**$48 Billion.** That's how much funding has gone into AI-focused startups so far this year. It's expected to reach **~$71Bn**.

**Attention = Money**. More students and researchers want to start companies based on their research.

**4. Safety**.

People are being vocal about their concerns for AI and the **number of researches dedicated to AI safety has tripled.**

Safety research has pulled in more money than in years past.

### **Diagnosing patients based off your voice**

What would you make with $100M?

Well, The National Institutes of Health is collecting **30k voices with medical disorders**.

And with that data, they claim to be able to **diagnose; neurological, voice, mood, respiratory and pediatric disorders like autism and speech delays**.

Then they‚Äôll turn that into an app which can advise you to seek medical attention.

But it‚Äôll take 4 years.

### **Product Roundup**

Difficulty coming up with stories for your kid? Once upon a bot has got you covered. **Generate a random story about anything** <https://onceuponabot.com/>

**Elad Gil is hosting an interview with OpenAI co-founder, Sam Altman** tonight (too late for me). I‚Äôll post a summary of the interview tomorrow. <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x_Y8lKnMdQ>

**No more boring backgrounds**. Magically generate an infinite number of unique backgrounds <https://twitter.com/DataChaz/status/1579587991919792128>

[**Invoke AI**](https://github.com/invoke-ai/InvokeAI)- A version of Stable Diffusion you can run on your computer. It provides a polished Web interface and an easy-to-use command-line interface.

But either way, you need to be fairly technical to get it set up on your own computer.

I hope it's like GTA Vice City!

That's it! See ya ‚úåÔ∏è
