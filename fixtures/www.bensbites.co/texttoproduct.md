Hey everyone. Some of you mentioned broken links in yesterday's email - I'm sorry, this was a bug from the provider of the email provider. Kind of stuck there but it should be resolved ASAP.

I'm experimenting with a few ideas; tutorials, meetups and hackathons. I'll post them here when there's more (see Learn section re: tutorials), register interest for a London meetup with me [here](https://lu.ma/bensbites) - location TBD. If you want to hang in Discord, [here's the invite](https://discord.gg/hmFBEPR8).

Ok, what's AI got in store for us today...

### **ü§å Ben's Picks**

- **Text-to-product**. Qatalog 2.0 was released today, I got an early look at it on Monday, and it‚Äôs pretty impressive! You can enter a term like ‚Äòmarketplace‚Äô and **the product will build the entire backend for you**. It knows you need sellers and users, products and all of the related fields like profile picture, email, images, links, you name it. This is a seriously interesting product that I‚Äôm not sure many people thought was this close to being a reality. ([<u>link</u>](https://qatalog.com/))
