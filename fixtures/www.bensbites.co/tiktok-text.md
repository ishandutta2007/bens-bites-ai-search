Hey folks, this is Ben's Bites - your AI bestie.

Yesterday I found out Veal Milanese is actually from Milan...And that it tastes the same pretty much anywhere. We had our first meal out last night and now getting ready to go shopping all day as it's my wife's birthday - so happy birthday to her! (no she doesn't read this or know remotely what I do for a living)

Let's get to it, I hope your day is less expensive than mine.

[**Massive funding round for storytelling start-up Tome**](https://twitter.com/alexrkonrad/status/1628387173631246338?s=12\&t=430HwaY1R-r6DiuaJwqqaA)

That is one *monster* funding round - **$43m**, valuing the start-up at a whopping $300m, *before* revenue. When you hear of **Tome** as a ‚Äústorytelling‚Äù company, you‚Äôre probably imagining less than it is - but these guys are lining up to be PowerPoint‚Äôs first big competitor. By ‚Äústory‚Äù they mean ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù, and the idea is AI-generated tiles able to create a compelling narrative behind anything: children‚Äôs stories, pitch decks, 3D prototypes - you name it. (Basically PowerPoint but‚Ä¶ better.) This is a really cool start-up and provides some welcome competition. But what‚Äôs Microsoft‚Äôs response going to be when they get backed into an AI corner?

[**Personalised news with Artifact app made available to all**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/22/instagrams-co-founders-personalized-news-app-artifact-launches-to-the-public-with-new-features/)

The Instagram co-founders have put together a team of pure tech veterans to muster up the newest news service on the block. It‚Äôs called **Artifact**, it centres itself around **personalisation and social networks**, and is now available to everyone. If you‚Äôre like me, you‚Äôre asking yourself: ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt all news services personalised these days? What‚Äôs new?‚Äù That‚Äôs true, but they‚Äôre relying on a few core aspects making them strong competition in a highly saturated market - and the biggest one is the presence of **social/interest bubbles**. Your suggestions will be influenced by what your in-app contacts are reading. I‚Äôm interested‚Ä¶

**3/**

[**Spotify to launch an assistant DJ AI whilst you listen to music**](https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/22/spotify-launches-dj-a-new-personalized-music-lineup-that-includes-ai-powered-commentary/)

I actually think that **Spotify‚Äôs** music suggestions are *spot on* (pun definitely not intended), so I‚Äôm pretty intrigued by this new tool that they‚Äôre set to announce at their upcoming *Stream On*event. It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòDJ‚Äô, and as far as I can tell it‚Äôs a combination of **music suggestions**, synthetic **voice generation**, and **generative chat** to let you join an actual DJ-type-AI whilst you listen. It‚Äôll introduce songs, provide some background, and guide you through your tunes. It seems pretty cool, and looks to be more interactive than something that just moves through music suggestions, hopefully allowing it to learn your preferences even faster.

**4/**

[**Get app and website mockups from a prompt with Autodesign by Uizard**](https://uizard.io/autodesigner/)

I‚Äôm seriously inept when it comes to design creativity, so when I see AI getting applied to create tools that‚Äôll help me *design creatively*it always piques my interest. **Uizard** (yeah, *awesome* name) have presented **Autodesign**, their new tool that allows you to enter a prompt and get a load of **multi-screen mock-ups** for UIs on apps and websites. The demo looks pretty sweet, and something I‚Äôd definitely use. Man, I can‚Äôt stop thinking about how cool their name is!
