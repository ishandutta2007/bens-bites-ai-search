Roll up, roll up! Welcome one and all to the most spectacular email on earth! The AI circus is in town and we've got a lineup of acts that will leave you in awe.

Me getting ready to write the email:

Let's get to it.

*ps. a bunch of [meetups going on](https://meetups.bensbites.co/) very soon - see if there's one in a town near you.*

### ü§å Ben's Picks

#### 1/

An update on the AI love story of the year, Microsoft & OpenAI; ‚ÄúOnce **$92 billion in profit** plus $13 billion in initial investment are repaid (to Microsoft) and once the other venture **investors earn $150 billion**, all of the equity reverts back to OpenAI.‚Äù This was from the article in Fortune: "**[Inside the structure of OpenAI‚Äôs looming new investment from Microsoft and VCs](https://fortune.com/2023/01/11/structure-openai-investment-microsoft/)**". Gary Marcus commented about it [here](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/is-microsoft-about-to-get-the-deal).

Then The Information published its piece, "**[Microsoft + OpenAI: Inside Tech‚Äôs Hottest Romance](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/microsoft-openai-inside-techs-hottest-romance?rc=bdorru)**", which revealed a few more interesting points.

- proposing nonprofit status again after profit is paid back
- potentially increasing investor cap. Instead of hard cap, 20% increase per year. So investors can still get VC-like returns
- Altman hasn‚Äôt got equity in the for profit arm. Unclear if this deal changes that

I wonder what today will bring for this story...

#### 2/

**Andrej Karparthy**, previously Director of AI at Tesla, and OpenAI, launched (not on purpose) his project: [**NanoGPT - The simplest, fastest repository for training/fine tuning medium-sized GPTs**](https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT). In 2 weeks, Andrej is releasing a video where he 'will build nanoGPT from scratch and aspire to spell everything out'. It'll be the last video from his series '**[Neural Networks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)**[- Zero to hero](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ)'.

For those of you who don't know, I work at Zapier. I'm now focusing on people who want to build with AI + Zapier for anything! My teammate, Reid, wrote this awesome blog post: **[How to write an](https://zapier.com/blog/gpt-3-prompt/)** **[effective GPT-3 prompt](https://zapier.com/blog/gpt-3-prompt/).**

*p.s. I'm running a build program for using AI and Zapier. If you want access, pop your email [here](https://ai.zapier.app/sign-up). I'll be letting users into the Slack regularly. We'll show what we've built and how, give feedback for products and feature/integration requests.*
