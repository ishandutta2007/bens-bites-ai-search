Hey folks, and welcome to 6770 of you who joined last week. Last week was bonkers, so I took the weekend to play with my nephew and hang with my family.

The weekend was comparatively quieter, except for Sam Altman saying that, yes, AI will take away many jobs from today‚Äôs world. More about AI helping teachers, Stable Diffusion, LLaMA and Apalca in today‚Äôs edition.

Let‚Äôs get to it.

### ü§å Our Picks

###### Highlights if you've only got 2 minutes

**1/**

[Hard-hitting interview with the top dogs at OpenAI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop\&v=540vzMlf-54)

Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO) and Mira Murati (CTO) clearly spend more time practising for interviews than training ML models because they absolutely aced this one with ABC News - and it was*tough*.**Hard-hitting and direct questions**, a targeted approach of concern, and a stern tone brought this interview straight to the point and got a lot of info out of the top dogs in AI. Altman is ‚Äúa bit scared‚Äù (naturally); he thinks**society needs to be given time to adapt**; they will adjust the technology as negative things occur; and we‚Äôve gotta learn as much as we can whilst the\*\*‚Äústakes are still low‚Äù\*\*. And Murati is just about the most calm and collected person I‚Äôve seen on screen - check the two of them out in the YouTube vid linked above!

I know there‚Äôs a lot of chatter at the moment around scepticism of how much OpenAI*actually*cares about safe releases and AI alignment, but I get the impression they really do. According to Altman, GPT-4 was finished**7 months ago**, and since then all their focus has been on getting it to be as safe as possible. But perhaps I‚Äôve been totally hoodwinked‚Ä¶

**2/**

[Ethan Mollick outlines ways in which AI can help teachers to teach better](https://oneusefulthing.substack.com/p/using-ai-to-make-teaching-easier)

Our resident DJ for advocating integrating**chatbot AI in education**is back on the scene, but this time he‚Äôs focussing on how they can**help teachers**, rather than how to enhance a student‚Äôs learning. In his latest post, Ethan Mollick outlines 5 key aspects of teaching where chatbot technologies can be utilised to both**boost teacher productivity**and improve their approach. Fit with the perfect prompts to guide the outputs, he runs through example/case study generation, AI-powered technical explanations, low-stakes test building, and more. All things that teachers can develop alongside the AIs, helping both themselves*and*students. Bring on more AI in education I say!

**3/**

[Stability AI‚Äôs Clipdrop helps you to reimagine existing images](https://stability.ai/blog/stable-diffusion-reimagine)

With my bedroom decor starting to look*very*tired, I could really do with an assistant to help reimagine how it could look so I can spice things up a bit. And it looks like**Stable Diffusion‚Äôs**latest work with**Clipdrop**could help me do just that. Their new tool, Reimagine, acting as a kind of**image-to-image**model, takes an input image and ‚Äòreimagines‚Äô how it could look, producing new images that are essentially modifications of the first. You can even select**detail enhancements**, pushing viewers to focus on an aspect of an image that wasn‚Äôt quite capturing their attention before. Looks pretty cool! I can see applications in portrait photos, architecture, design, and a heck of a lot more.

**4/**

[If you haven‚Äôt already, then get to know about llama.cpp](https://twitter.com/ggerganov/status/1637550966814777345?s=12\&t=4DFLsyWB2nlmdJs1ZUkj1A)

For all you AI hacky types out there, you‚Äôve either already heard of**llama.cpp**, or you haven‚Äôt and need to hear about it ASAP. For those of you that don‚Äôt know, this developer in Bulgaria put it together to compress**Meta‚Äôs LLaMA models**into a far more manageable size for your home laptops - a 4-bit quantization approach for your Macs. Big jumps towards democratising AI! And according to him, the llama.cpp repo is buzzing with activity, with double-digit numbers of pull requests in the space of an hour*on a Sunday*.

It‚Äôs also reaching[other projects](https://github.com/antimatter15/alpaca.cpp)too. These folks have taken the LLaMA foundation model, Stanford‚Äôs Alpaca chatbot model, and then messed about a bit with llama.cpp to produce**alpaca.cpp**, giving us a ChatGPT-style model with just 4GB of weights. (That‚Äôs small by the way‚Ä¶)
