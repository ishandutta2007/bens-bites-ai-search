Hello and welcome from sunny Austin. I spent the last day or so exploring the city and bumped into someone I went to university with, in a packed bar. Bizarre!

This is Ben's Bites your personal AI news bulletin. Today's a long one, don't stress - it's ok to miss a few links. We'll be back tomorrow üòä

Let's get to it.

### ü§å Ben's Picks

**1/**

[**I built a vintage image colorizer & restorer using Zapier & Replicate AI models**](https://medium.com/@Michael_Toth/i-built-a-vintage-image-colorizer-restorer-using-zapier-replicate-ai-models-a38c1a49c774)

I spoke with Michael last week and tasked him with coming up with an AI workflow idea to build without code and this is what he came out with. There's a step-by-step video and text tutorial and it's awesome. Learning this kind of process is adaptable to almost any AI model (whisper, stable diffusion, etc) so the possibilities are endless. Give it a go and build something - then tag me (@bentossell) so I can show it off here üòä

**2/**

[**OpenAI hiring thousands to write code for generative coding tool**](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/27/2023/openai-has-hired-an-army-of-contractors-to-make-basic-coding-obsolete)

How many unpaid coding interviews does it take to build up a training set for a coding bot? That‚Äôs not the start of a joke - [**OpenAI are on a global hiring spree**](https://www.semafor.com/article/01/27/2023/openai-has-hired-an-army-of-contractors-to-make-basic-coding-obsolete), as reported by Semafor, to get hold of low-cost labour to conduct basic coding tasks, with unpaid coding tests lasting up to 5 hours. The end goal? Most likely to **build up a robust training set** of descriptive code/debugging to develop truly powerful **coding co-pilots**. Now I understand the tweet that Andrej Karpathy sent out last week: ‚ÄùThe hottest new programming language is English‚Äù.

**3/**

[**Multi¬∑ON: Web browsing co-pilot using ChatGPT**](https://multion.ai/)

Does anyone else find it kinda unnerving when you give control of your computer to a tech support person and their mouse is jumping around your page working its magic? Well you‚Äôll find it even spookier with the [**Multi¬∑ON plugin**](https://multion.ai/), which is exactly that except it‚Äôs **ChatGPT** doing your tasks **on your actual browser**. In [**this example**](https://twitter.com/divgarg9/status/1619073088192417792?s=12\&t=XUeaXLAme0lYbXomhWklig) ChatGPT successfully gets hold of the world‚Äôs first **AI-ordered burger** using Doordash in Palo Alto - as if I needed any more temptations to add to my Christmas pounds this early in 2023!

It‚Äôs not clear from the demos how complicated the tasks can get, with the examples being pretty basic things like navigating well-known websites, posting tweets, and following Sam Altman. So it‚Äôll be cool to see how this develops with time, such as being able to execute the statements without having to watch it click around.

[**Generative AI finds proteins that kill bacteria**](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2356597-ai-has-designed-bacteria-killing-proteins-from-scratch-and-they-work/)

The transformational, game-changing **advances in biology** made over the past year using AI technology have successfully been pulled into 2023. [***New Scientist*****reports**](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2356597-ai-has-designed-bacteria-killing-proteins-from-scratch-and-they-work/) that researchers using generative AI have been able to identify **new antimicrobial protein structures** that were able to kill *E. coli*bacteria, opening up huge **potential for new drug development**. They trained large language models to learn the grammar of how amino acids are combined to form proteins - wow!
