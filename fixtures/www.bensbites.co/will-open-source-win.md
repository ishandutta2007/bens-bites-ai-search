Hey folks, today we‚Äôve got RedPajama releasing a 1.2 trillion-word dataset model, MiniGPT-4 with multi-model functionality (tell me what‚Äôs in this image) and an interesting economic case for AI not stealing our jobs (phew).

The Ben‚Äôs Bites x Every Hackathon kicks off today; build something related to AI. It‚Äôs that straightforward! [Join the discord](https://discord.gg/ben-s-bites-1039224571376701510?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=will-open-source-win) to take part, Dan and I will be hosting on the Stage at 12 am ET.

[RedPajama is the biggest open-source rival to Big Tech yet](https://www.together.xyz/blog/redpajama?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=will-open-source-win)

You‚Äôve gotta love the determination of**open-source**to go toe-to-toe with Big Tech - it reminds me of all that GameStop stuff a few years back! And**RedPajama**is the latest initiative looking to drive this forward with*bold*goals. They have a 3-step plan to rival the big dogs with fully open-source, reproducible, leading language models: 1) Produce a dataset, 2) Train a suite of base models, and 3) Implement instruction-tuning.

Today they announce the completion of stage 1 - a**1.2-trillion-word dataset**mimicking that used to train**LLaMA**. With promises of fully-trained base models released in a matter of weeks and apparent progress on instruction tuning with OpenChatKit, I can feel the trembling of something big in the pipeline.

[MiniGPT-4 has beaten OpenAI to a chatbot that can describe images](https://minigpt-4.github.io/?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=will-open-source-win)

Believe it or not, someone‚Äôs actually managed to deliver something faster than**OpenAI**. These researchers at King Abdullah University have unveiled a chatbot feature that[OpenAI has been promising](https://twitter.com/simonw/status1647974477396054016)for a while now: the ability to answer questions about specific images.

Called**MiniGPT-4**, it‚Äôs built on top of something called**BLIP-2**as well as a**LLaMA-derived language model**. (You can‚Äôt read anything AI-related these days without being reminded of those long necks and strange faces!) For those of you wanting to get really stuck in, they plan to release a 7B parameter model which might be just the one for you

**3/**

[An interesting economic case for why AI won‚Äôt steal jobs](https://www.notboring.co/p/intelligence-superabundance?utm_source=bensbites\&utm_medium=referral\&utm_campaign=will-open-source-win)

Time to get a little bit philosophical and a tad economics-ish on you guys - this is a great blog post on the impact of AI on jobs! The*Not Boring*post uses two real-life economic quirks/principles/whatever to make the argument that the**supply of AI**will unlock a\*\*‚Äòlatent‚Äô demand**for services, whereas increasing abilities simply means that**people will demand\*\*far higher speed and quality of services.

Within the framework of the whole**impact-on-jobs debate**: added demand means jobs would be far less likely to get displaced as the required output will jump so much. Designers will have to design much better and much faster; people will sue far more people as legal docs become easier to draw up; and consultants will be expected to consult much more efficiently.
