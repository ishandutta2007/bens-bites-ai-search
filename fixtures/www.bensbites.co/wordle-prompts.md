Hey everyone, it's the end of the week! It's been a busy one in AI (and on Twitter in general - is it still working?) Welcome to the 121 new folks joining since yesterday.

Have a great weekend - it's pizza-making for us in Ben's Bites household. I'm not trusted to roll out the dough, strictly pizza-oven duties ü´° (no to pineapple).

If you remember yesterday I shared Suhail shared his dataset from PlaygroundAI. Well, this is why‚Ä¶people are now building on top of it. [<u>**This tool helps you to analyze and inspect the images and corresponding prompts from Playground AI Images**</u>](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ysharma/Playground_AI_Exploration).

Meta has released [<u>**ImageNetX**</u>](https://facebookresearch.github.io/imagenetx/site/home), which is a set of human annotations of factors such as pose, background, or lighting for the entire ImageNet1k validation set as well as a random subset of 12k training images. **The dataset is used to study the types of mistakes made by 2,200 current recognition models**.

a16z have come out with another post around AI, [<u>**The Generative AI Revolution in Games**</u>](https://a16z.com/2022/11/17/the-generative-ai-revolution-in-games/). It discusses how generative AI is transforming the gaming industry by allowing for the creation of high-quality images in a fraction of the time it would take to generate them by hand. It also outlines the various segments of the generative AI market for games and identifies key companies in each.

The article discusses [<u>**the concept of emergent abilities**</u>](https://www.yitay.net/blog/emergence-and-scaling). It argues that scale is not the only factor that matters in determining these abilities, and that inductive biases (i.e. the assumptions made about the data when designing a model) can also have a significant impact. (Similar to the article I shared on emergence yesterday).

[<u>**AI-generated game assets**</u>](https://www.scenario.gg/). Create high-quality, style-consistent, proprietary assets for your games.

Swift Ventures and AI pub co-wrote a piece ‚Äú[<u>**The Next Generation of Large Language Models Will Blow Your Mind and Disrupt Your Business**</u>](https://blog.swift.vc/the-next-generation-of-large-language-models-will-blow-your-mind-and-disrupt-your-business-3b913d6dfa8a)‚Äú. The article discusses the upcoming launch of GPT-4, and how it will be a more powerful and disruptive model than its predecessors.\
*Key takeaways:*\
The **next generation of large language models will be more powerful, multi-prompt, agentic, and knowledgeable**.\
These models will be able to execute long chains of reasoning and correct their own work.\
The next big trend after "generative AI" may be "agentic AI."

Contentinator is a new [<u>**Figma plugin that lets you populate your designs with realistic content**</u>](https://contentinator.com/) of basically anything, with AI (of course).
