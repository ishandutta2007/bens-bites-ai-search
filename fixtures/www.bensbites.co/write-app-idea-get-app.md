Thanks for reading! Ben‚Äôs Bites is a roundup of what‚Äôs going on in AI.\

Ok ok, what on earth happened?!\
In yesterday's email, I said subs grew 4x from the previous day.\
Now, **double it**, that's where we're at today ü§Ø‚ù§Ô∏è. Almost at 300! Not bad for 5 days.

Sorry for all that scrolling and extra white space yesterday. I'm still testing the format, let me know if any weird formatting happens for you - I'll fix it. I also removed guess that prompt from today's email, let's just have the cool shit going on, shall we? (tell me if I should bring it back though)

Let's get going!

**Prompt**: List the topics in today‚Äôs email:

üé® An AI assistant designer you just talk to and it makes things\
üìù Write your app idea ‚Üí get the app\
üë∂ AI fetal ultrasounds\
üßë‚Äçüíª A tool for starting your own AI startupüí∞ Coatue raised $500M to fund AI

## **ü´¶ BEN'S BITES**

Coatue is **[raising a $500 million early-stage fund with a focus on AI](https://twitter.com/KateClarkTweets/status/1580546561032867843)**, among other sectors. This was published by The Information ($700+/yr) so I took the hit and here are the main takeaways:\
\- Coatue invested in Stability AI (makers of Stable Diffusion) at a $500M valuation\
\- They believe AI is on the cusp of exponential adoption by the general population. It's gone from "side research to mainstream, getting into every application".\
\- For this fund, AI is a big focus. They're bullish on the space (aren't we all üòâ).\
\- They're looking to fund everything from "how you run AI in production on the chip all the way up to writing and having products and applications on AI"

ü§Ø Holy shit. A **[proof-of-concept AI assistant designer](https://twitter.com/imcharleslo/status/1580591523447844865?s=12\&t=rthsf6MTikLe3MAZwpQnvA)**. In the demo, a guy speaks out loud to a human/cyborg on a screen asking how they are etc and it responds. But the crazy thing is then the guy asks the AI to draw an apple, a cat in a bottle (*he switches from Chinese to English when speaking here - using Whisper*) and even crazier, he says ‚Äòlet's design a house‚Äô, it asks for materials, location, season etc‚Ä¶Honestly you [have to watch it](https://twitter.com/imcharleslo/status/1580591523447844865?s=12\&t=rthsf6MTikLe3MAZwpQnvA).

**PlaygroundAI [just released ‚Äòdraw-to-image‚Äô](https://twitter.com/playground_ai/status/1580695471894319105?s=12\&t=rthsf6MTikLe3MAZwpQnvA)** which is impressive for many reasons. One is that you can draw literally a stick outline of a duck, and it‚Äôll generate full digital variations of an image. I'll have a deep-dive with the founder soon üòè

\*\*[Training AI to have feelings](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/m7uoh44qcQzGSnKme/feelings)\*\*üò≥. When AI understands emotion, it could help distil information to be less chaotic for example.

A great, [funny thread of responses](https://twitter.com/anloremi/status/1580220950163099649?s=12\&t=yiIznVBTXhQLIBZwguU8zg) to ‚Äò**Complete this image in a way that proves you won‚Äôt be replaced by AI**‚Äô.

Following the Stable Diffusion Discord Drama (which I spoke about 2 emails ago). **Emad (SD founder) [posts a public apology](https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y34h2a/emad_posts_a_public_apology_to_automatic1111_on/) to the moderator**. Although it was posted on GitHub, and it was apparently after doing so in person yesterday ü§î.

Sound familiar? *‚ÄòHey developer in my team, can you quickly pull some analytics from SQL as I have no idea how to use it?‚Äô* Well now, you can **[use GPT-3 to let people chat with their database instead of having to write SQL](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/y2uxf4/im_using_gpt3_to_let_people_chat_with_their/)**. Here's the [link to the actual product page](https://rawquery.com/). (p.s. I was that person asking my dev friends whilst at Product Hunt üò¨)

[This new proposal](https://twitter.com/HuaxiuYaoML/status/1580021150007951363) can quickly adapt to the **recommendation for a new drug** with limited prescription data from a few support patients. Better recommendations, faster.

**[Qualcomm is hiring AI research interns](https://twitter.com/TacoCohen/status/1580588285436755968)**. It‚Äôs 4 months long and based in the Netherlands. They‚Äôre hoping to make ‚Äòbreakthroughs in AI to scale them across industries‚Äô.

Wanting to **start your own AI startup**? [Lightning AI has released an update](https://twitter.com/_willfalcon/status/1580240057486540800) and new apps framework to help you do just that.

There‚Äôs a shortage of adequately trained workers who can perform Fetal ultrasounds. But now, [there‚Äôs a proposal](https://twitter.com/AmyCChou/status/1579941203248021504) that **allows AI to run on-device, with no internet and provide feedback to assist in training ultrasound operators** in low-resource settings. The accuracy is on par with existing clinical standards.

There‚Äôs [a Stable Diffusion Photoshop plugin](https://twitter.com/cantrell/status/1580562366629965824) that lets you **generate images on your own computer!**

[**Two side projects from Kyle**](https://twitter.com/ksredelinghuys/status/1580888994061377537) around AI images: cardpossible (the perfect unique card for any occasion) and gallerai (share images and prompts).

[A good view](https://twitter.com/rasbt/status/1580546348835041289) on **‚ÄòAI vs human intelligence‚Äô:**

Humans can go pick up coffee beans, grind them, boil water, read the instructions for an Aeropress & brew a nice cup of coffee. Good luck teaching that to an AI.

An AI can predict 3D structures of proteins by just looking at a bunch of letters. Good luck teaching that to a human.

ü™Ñ Write your app idea ‚Üí get an app. **[This new tool - Buildt - does just that](https://buildt.ai/).** The video demo on their site shows you how. Currently early access only - I‚Äôm on another the list! [They have a page here](https://trumpet.app/pods/63120f663483f3f0d3b49ed5/live) which, when you enter an email, shows a lot more about what they're building, why, the founders etc. I've got a call with the founders on Monday - so I shall report back soon.
